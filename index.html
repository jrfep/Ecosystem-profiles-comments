<h1> The IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology</h1>

<p>We invite you to visit the official site for the <a href="https://global-ecosystems.org" target="_blank">IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology</a>.</p>

  <p>The <b>IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology</b> comprises six hierarchical levels to support applications across global to local scales. The three upper levels classify ecosystems based on their functional characteristics, irrespective of species composition. The three lower levels of classification distinguish functionally similar ecosystems from one another based on compositional resemblance and enable integration of established classifications already in use and incorporated into policy infrastructure at national levels. This is crucial, as important conservation action occurs at local levels, where most expertise resides.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<h2>Consultation and feedback</h2>

<p>The <b style='font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;'>IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management</b> co-ordinated <a href="Development.html">series of workshops and meetings during 2017-2019</a> to develop, review and refine the <a href="https://iucnrle.org/about-rle/ongoing-initiatives/global-ecosystem-typology/" target="_blank">Global Ecosystem Typology</a>. The framework was also presented at a number of international symposia, offering opportunities for input to a wide range of ecosystem experts.</p>
