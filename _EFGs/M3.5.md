# Ecosystem properties

Benthic, sessile suspension-feeders such as aphotic corals, sponges, and bivalves form structurally complex, three-dimensional structures or ‘animal forests’ in the deep oceans. In contrast to their shallow-water counterparts in coastal and shelf systems (M1.5), these ecosystems are aphotic and rely on allochthonous energy sources borne in currents and pelagic fallout. The trophic web is dominated by filter-feeders, decomposers, detritivores, and predators. Primary producers and associated herbivores are only present at the interface with the photic zone (~250 m depth). The biogenic structures are slow growing but critical to local demersal biota in engineering shelter from predators and currents, particularly in shallower, more dynamic waters. They also provide stable substrates and enhance food availability. This habitat heterogeneity becomes more important with depth as stable, complex elevated substrate becomes increasingly limited. These structures and the microenvironments within them support a high diversity of associated species including symbionts, microorganisms in coral biofilm, filter-feeding epifauna, biofilm grazers, mobile predators (e.g. polychaetes and crustaceans), and benthic demersal fish. Diversity is positively related to the size, flexibility, and structural complexity of habitat-forming organisms. Their impact on hydrography and the flow of local currents increases retention of particulate matter, zooplankton, eggs and larvae from the water column. This creates positive conditions for suspension-feeders, which engineer their environment and play important roles in benthic-pelagic coupling, increasing the flux of matter and energy from the water column to the benthic community.

# Ecological Drivers

The productivity of surface water, the vertical flux of nutrients, water temperature, and hydrography influence the availability of food, and hence the distribution and function of deep-water biogenic beds. Although these systems occur on both hard and soft substrates, the latter are less structurally complex and less diverse. Chemical processes are important and ocean acidity is limiting. The presence of cold-water corals, for example, has been linked to the depth of aragonite saturation. Habitat-forming species prefer regions characterised by oxygenation and currents or high flow, generally avoiding oxygen-minimum zones. Benthic biogenic structures and their dependents are highly dependent on low levels of physical disturbance due to slow growth rates and recovery times.

# Distribution

Patchy but widespread distribution across the deep sea floor below 250 m depth. Poorly explored and possibly less common on abyssal plains.
