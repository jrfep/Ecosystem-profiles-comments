# Ecological traits


Benthic, sessile suspension-feeders such as aphotic corals, sponges and bivalves form structurally-complex, three-dimensional structures or ‘animal forests’ in the deep oceans. In contrast to their shallow-water counterparts in coastal and shelf systems (M1.5), these ecosystems are aphotic and rely on allochthonous energy sources borne in currents and pelagic fallout. Hence, the trophic web is dominated by filter feeders, decomposers, detritivores and predators. Primary producers and associated herbivores are only present at the interface with the photic zone around 250 m depth. The biogenic structures are slow growing, but critical to local demersal biota in engineering shelter from predators and currents, particularly in shallower, more dynamic waters. They also provide stable substrates and enhance food availability. This habitat heterogeneity becomes more important with depth, as stable, complex elevated substrate becomes increasingly limited. These structures and the microenvironments within them support a high diversity of associated species including symbionts, microorganisms in coral biofilm, filter-feeding epifauna, biofilm grazers, mobile predators (e.g. polychaetes, crustaceans) and benthic demersal fish.  Diversity is positively related to the size, flexibility and structural complexity of the habitat-forming organisms. Their impact on hydrography and the flow of local currents increases retention of particulate matter, zooplankton, e.g. and larvae from the water column. This, in turn, creates positive conditions for the suspension feeders, which thus engineer their environment and play important roles in benthic-pelagic coupling, increasing the flux of matter and energy from the water column to the benthic community.


# Key-ecological-drivers


The productivity of surface water, vertical flux of nutrients, water temperature and hydrography influence the availability of food, and hence the distribution and function of deepwater biogenic beds. Although these systems occur on both hard and soft substrates, the latter are less structurally complex and hence less diverse. Chemical processes are important and ocean acidity is limiting: the presence of cold water corals for example has been strongly linked to the aragonite saturation depth. Habitat-forming species prefer regions characterised by oxygenation and currents or high flow, and are generally not found in oxygen-minimum zones. Benthic biogenic structures and their dependents are highly dependent on low levels of physical disturbance due to slow growth rates and recovery times of the structural dominants.

# Distribution


 Patchy but widespread distribution across the deep sea floor below 250m depth. Poorly explored and possibly less common on abyssal plains.


## Map details

The indicative map of Deepwater biogenic beds was based on the ‘mountains’ and ‘hills’ classes within the abyssal geomorphic unit of of Harris et al. (2014). These were mapped in yellow as minor occurrences to acknowledges considerable uncertainties in the distribution of biogenic beds within these geomorphic units.
