# Ecological traits

These spring systems are groundwater-dependant because they are surrounded by dry landscapes and receive little surface inflow, being predominantly disconnected from surface stream networks. This insularity from the broader landscape results in high levels of endemism in sedentary aquatic biota, which are likely descendants of relic species from a long-ago and wetter past. Springs may be spatially clustered due to their association with geological features such as faults or outcropping aquifers. Even springs in close proximity, however, may have distinct physical and biological differences. Some springs have outflow streams, which may support different assemblages of plants and invertebrates to those in the spring orifice. Artesian springs and oases tend to have relatively simple trophic structure. The autotrophs include aquatic algae and floating vascular plants, with emergent amphibious plants in shallow waters. Terrestrial plants around the perimeter contribute subsidies of organic matter and nutrients through litter fall. Consumers and predators include crustaceans, molluscs, arachnids, insects and small-bodied fish. Most biota are poorly dispersed, and have continuous life cycles and other traits specialised for persistence in hydrologically stable, warm or hot mineral-rich water. Springs and oases are reliable watering points for wide-ranging birds and mammals that function as mobile links for resources and promote dispersal of other biota between isolated wetlands in the dryland matrix.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Flow of artesian water to the surface is critical to these wetlands, which receive little input from precipitation or runoff.  Hydrological variability is low compared to other wetland types, but complex hydrological connections with deep regional aquifers, basin-fill and local watershed recharge drive lagged flow dynamics. Flows also vary over geological time frames, with evidence of cyclic growing, waning and extinction. Discharge waters tend to have elevated temperatures,  enriched  concentrations of minerals that reflect their geological origins. Precipitation of dissolved minerals (e.g. carbonates) and deposition by wind and water form characteristic cones or mounds known as "mound springs". Perennial flows and hydrological isolation from other spatially and temporally restricted surface waters makes these wetlands important ecological refuges in arid landscapes.

# Distribution

Scattered through arid regions in southern Africa, the Sahara and Middle East, central Eurasia, southwest of North America and Australia’s Great Artesian Basin.
