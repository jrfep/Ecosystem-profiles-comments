These small rivers or streams in mountainous or hilly areas are characterised by steep gradients and fast flow. They flow all year, increasing in wet periods, in humid tropical and temperate zones. Stones are common along their rapids and pools, turning over and oxygenating the water. Dependent organisms are specialised for these high flow-velocity environments, with resources for food webs derived mainly from the stream and inputs from adjacent and upstream vegetation.

### Key Features

High-medium velocity, low-medium volume perennial flows with abundant benthic filter feeders, algal biofilms & small fish.

### Overview of distribution

Global uplands with wet climates.
