# Ecological traits

These mixed semi-deserts are dominated by suffrutescent or subsucculent perennial shrubs and tussock grasses. Productivity and biomass is limited by low average precipitation, extreme temperatures and, to a lesser extent, soil nutrients, but varies temporally in response to water availability. Vegetation takes a range of structural forms including open shrublands, mixed shrublands with a tussock grass matrix, prairie-like tall forb grasslands and very low dwarf shrubs interspersed with forbs or grasses. Total cover varies from 10 to 30% and the balance between shrubs and grasses is mediated by rainfall, herbivory and soil fertility. Stress-tolerator and ruderal life-history types are both strongly represented in flora and fauna. Trait plasticity and nomadism are also common. Traits promoting water capture and conservation in plants include xeromorphy, deep roots and C4 photosynthesis. Shrubs have small (less than nanophyll) non-sclerophyll (moderate SLA), often hairy leaves and act as resource accumulation sites, promoting heterogeneity over local spatial scales. C3 photosynthesis is represented in short-lived shrubs, forbs and grasses, enabling to them to exploit pulses of winter rain. Consumers include small mammalian and avian granivores, medium-sized mammalian herbivores and wide-ranging large mammalian and avian predators and scavengers.  Abundant detritivores consume dead matter rapidly and structure resource availability and habitat characteristics over small scales. Episodic rainfall initiates trophic pulses, with rapid responses by granivores and their predators, but less so by herbivores which have multiple traits that promote water conservation.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Semi-desert steppes is associated with fine-textured, non-acid soils of low-moderate fertility, and may contain appreciable levels of magnesium or sodium. Clay particles exchange mineral ions with plant roots and have reverse texture effects on moisture extraction. Semi-desert steppes are not typically fire-prone and occur in temperate arid climates.  Mean annual rainfall (c. 150-300 mm) is 5-50% of  evapotranspiration and has a winter maximum, but large rain events bring interannual pulses of water surplus. Temperatures are highly variable diurnally and seasonally often exceeding 40°C in summer and reaching 0°C in winters but rarely with snow.
