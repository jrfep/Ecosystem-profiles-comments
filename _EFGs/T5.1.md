# Ecosystem properties

These mixed semi-deserts are dominated by suffrutescent (i.e. with a woody base) or subsucculent (semi-fleshy) perennial shrubs and tussock grasses. Productivity and biomass are limited by low average precipitation, extreme temperatures and, to a lesser extent, soil nutrients, but vary temporally in response to water availability. Vegetation takes a range of structural forms including open shrublands, mixed shrublands with a tussock grass matrix, prairie-like tall forb grasslands, and very low dwarf shrubs interspersed with forbs or grasses. Total cover varies from 10% to 30% and the balance between shrubs and grasses is mediated by rainfall, herbivory, and soil fertility. Stress-tolerator and ruderal life-history types are strongly represented in flora and fauna. Trait plasticity and nomadism are also common. Traits promoting water capture and conservation in plants include xeromorphy, deep roots, and C4 photosynthesis. Shrubs have small (less than nanophyll), non-sclerophyll, often hairy leaves with moderate SLA. Shrubs act as resource-accumulation sites, promoting heterogeneity over local scales. C3 photosynthesis is represented in short-lived shrubs, forbs, and grasses, enabling them to exploit pulses of winter rain. Consumers include small mammalian and avian granivores, medium-sized mammalian herbivores, and wide-ranging large mammalian and avian predators and scavengers. Abundant detritivores consume dead matter and structure resource availability and habitat characteristics over small scales. Episodic rainfall initiates trophic pulses with rapid responses by granivores and their predators, but less so by herbivores, which show multiple traits promoting water conservation.

# Ecological Drivers

Semi-desert steppes are associated with fine-textured, calcareous soils of low-moderate fertility, and may contain appreciable levels of magnesium or sodium. Clay particles exchange mineral ions with plant roots and have ‘reverse texture effects’, limiting moisture extraction as soils dry. Indurated subsoils influence infiltration/runoff relationships and vegetation patterns. Semi-desert steppes are not typically fire-prone and occur in temperate-arid climates. Mean annual rainfall (~150–300 mm), with and has a winter maximum. Evapotranspiration is 2-20 times greater than precipitation, but large rain events bring inter-annual pulses of water surplus. Temperatures are highly variable diurnally and seasonally, often exceeding 40°C in summer and reaching 0°C in winters but rarely with snow.

# Distribution

Extensive areas across the Sahara, the Arabian Peninsula, west Asia, southwest Africa, southern Australia, Argentina, and the Midwest USA.

{% capture map_det %}
Major and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al., 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al., 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile.
