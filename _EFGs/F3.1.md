# Ecological traits

Rivers are impounded by construction of dam walls, creating large freshwater reservoirs, mostly 15 – 250 m deep. Primary productivity is low to moderate and restricted to the euphotic zone (limnetic and littoral zones), varying with turbidity and associated light penetration, nutrient availability and water temperature. Trophic networks are simple with low species diversity and endemism. Shallow littoral zones have the highest species diversity including benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, aquatic reptiles, aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial or amphibious vertebrates. Phytoplankton and zooplankton occur through the littoral and limnetic zones. The profundal zone lacks primary producers and is dominated by benthic detritivores and microbial decomposers. Fish communities inhabit the limnetic and littoral zones and may be dominated by managed species and opportunists. Like natural lakes of similar size, reservoirs undergo trophic succession from oligotrophic to eutrophic states, but generally at more rapid rates.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Reservoirs receive water from the rivers which they impound. Human management to release or divert water compounds natural variability in inflow and evaporation, and may result in large variations in water level producing wide e.g. zones that are intermittently inundated or dry. This limits the productivity of water margins and the number of species able to persist there. Inflows may contain high concentrations of phosphorus and/or nitrogen (e.g. from sewerage treatment effluents or fertilised farmland), leading to eutrophication. Reservoirs in upper catchments generally receive less nutrients and cooler water (due to altitude) than those located downstream. Geomorphology, substrate and land use of the river basin influence the amount of inflowing suspended sediment, and hence turbidity, light penetration and productivity of planktonic and benthic algae, as well as rates of sediment build up on the reservoir floor. Wind-driven re-suspension of sediments increases supply of nutrients and organic particles in the water column, and reduces light available for photosynthesis. Depth gradients in light and oxygen, as well as thermal stratification, strongly influence the structure of biotic communities and trophic interactions, as do human introductions of fish, aquatic plants and other alien species.
