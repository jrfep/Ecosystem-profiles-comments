# Short description

Waters flowing rapidly through artificial conduits are typically bereft of their own primary producers in the absence of light and rely on imported algae and detritus as sources of energy. These support simple bacterial and fungal communities in biofilms and largely itinerant invertebrates. Diversity, abundance and productivity are low, but filter feeders may colonise and productivity may be higher if source waters supply nutrients and organic carbon.

# Key Features

Artificial flowing waterbodies that carry water with variable flow regime, limited light, sometimes with high carbon and nutrients supporting opportunities aquatic detritivores and predators

# Distribution

Ubiquitous in developed regions of the world, most commonly in urban landscapes and irrigation areas
