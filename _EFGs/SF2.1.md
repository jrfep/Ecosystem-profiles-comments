# Ecological Traits
 
Constructed subterranean canals and water pipes are dark, low-productivity systems acting as conduits for water, nutrients, and biota between artificial or natural freshwater ecosystems. Energy sources are therefore entirely or almost entirely allochthonous from surface systems. Although similar to underground streams (S2.1), these systems are structurally simpler, younger, and less biologically diverse with few evolutionary lineages and no local endemism. Diversity and abundance are low, often resulting from the accidental transport of biota from source to sink ecosystems. Trophic networks are truncated, with very few or no primary producers and no vertebrate predators except incidental transients. The majority of the resident heterotrophic biota are bacteria, aquatic fungi, and protists living in biofilms covering mostly smooth artificial surfaces or cut rock faces. Biofilms constitute food sources for detritivores and predators, including protozoans and planktonic invertebrates as well as filter feeders such as molluscs. The structure of the biofilm community varies considerably with hydraulic regime, as does the biota in the water column. Transient vertebrates, notably fish, occupy well-connected ecosystems with abundant food and predominantly depend on transported nutrients and prey. A range of organisms may survive in these environments but only some maintain reproductive populations. All biota are capable of surviving under no or low light conditions, at least temporarily while in transit. Other traits vary with hydraulic regimes and hydrochemistry, with physiological tolerance to toxins important in highly eutrophic, slow-flowing drains and tolerance to low nutrients and turbulence typical in high-velocity minerotrophic water pipes.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Subterranean canals and water pipes are engineered structures designed to connect and move waters between artificial (or more rarely natural) sources. They are united by an absence of light and usually low oxygen levels and low variability in temperatures, but hydraulic regimes, nutrient levels, water chemistry, flow and turbulence vary greatly among ecosystems. Water supply pipes are extreme oligotrophic systems with rapid flow, high turbulence, low nutrients and low connectivity to the atmosphere, often sourced from de-oxygenated water at depth within large reservoirs (F3.1). In contrast, subterranean wastewater or stormwater canals have slower, more intermittent flows, low turbulence, and very high nutrient levels and chemical pollutants including toxins. Many of these eutrophic systems have an in situ atmosphere, but dissolved oxygen levels are very low in connection with high levels of dissolved organic Carbon and microbial activity.

# Distribution
 
Common in landscapes with urban or industrial infrastructure including water supply and sewerage reticulation systems, hydroelectricity, irrigation, and other intensive agricultural industries.

{% capture map_det %}
Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing urban and industrialised areas with water transfer infrastructure were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/), maps of irrigation and other water infrastructure, and expertise of authors. Due to uncertainty and limited verification and likely limited spatial extent within mapped areas, all inferred occurrences were shown as minor at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution.
