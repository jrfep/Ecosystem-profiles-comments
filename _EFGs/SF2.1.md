# Ecological traits

Constructed subterranean canals and water pipes are dark, low-productivity systems, acting as conduits for water, nutrients and biota between artificial or natural freshwater ecosystems. Energy sources are therefore entirely or almost entirely allochthonous from surface systems. Although similar to underground streams (S2.1), these systems are structurally simpler, younger and much less biologically diverse with few evolutionary lineages and no local endemism. Diversity and abundance are low, often resulting from accidental transport of biota from source to receiving ecosystems.  Trophic networks are truncated, with very few or no primary producers and no vertebrate predators except incidental transients. The majority of the resident heterotrophic biota are bacteria, aquatic fungi and protists that live in biofilms covering mostly smooth artificial surfaces. The biofilms provide food sources for detritivores and predators including protozoans and planktonic invertebrates, as well as filter feeders such as molluscs. The structure of the biofilm community varies considerably with hydraulic regime, as does the biota in the water column. Transient vertebrates, notably fish, occupy well connected ecosystems with abundant food and predominantly depend on transported nutrients and behaviour of prey. A range of organisms may survive in these environments, but only some maintain reproductive populations. All biota are capable of surviving under no or low light conditions, at least temporarily while in transit. Other traits vary with hydraulic regimes and hydrochemistry, with physiological tolerance to toxins important in highly eutrophic, slow-flowing drains and tolerance to low nutrients and turbulence typical in high-velocity minerotrophic water pipes.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Subterranean canals and water pipes are engineered structures designed to connect and move waters between artificial (or more rarely natural) sources. They are united by an absence of light and usually by low oxygen levels and low variability in temperatures, but hydraulic regimes, nutrient levels, water chemistry, flow and turbulence vary greatly between different systems. Water supply pipes are extreme oligotrophic systems with rapid flow, high turbulence, low nutrients and low connectivity to the atmosphere, often sourced from de-oxygenated water at depth within large reservoirs (F3.1). In contrast, subterranean wastewater or stormwater canals have slower, more intermittent flows, low turbulence, and very high nutrient levels and chemical pollutants including toxins.  Many of these eutrophic systems have an in situ atmosphere, but dissolved oxygen levels are very low in connection with high levels of dissolved organic carbon and microbial activity.

# Distribution

Common in landscapes with urban or industrial infrastructure including water supply and sewerage reticulation systems, hydroelectricity, irrigation and other intensive agricultural industries.

## Map details

Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing occurrences of Water pipes and subterranean canals were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),   maps of irrigation and other water infrastructure, and expertise of authors. Due to uncertainty and limited verification, all inferred occurrences are shown in yellow
