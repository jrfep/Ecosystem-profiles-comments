# Ecological Traits
 

Coastal river deltas are prograding depositional systems, shaped by freshwater flows and influenced by wave and tidal flow regimes and substrate composition. The biota of these ecosystems reflects strong relationships with terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms at different spatial scales. Consequently, they typically occur as multi-scale mosaics, comprised of unique elements juxtaposed with other functional groups that extend far beyond deltaic influence, such as floodplain marshes (FT1.2) mangroves (MFT1.2), and sandy shorelines (TM1.3) and subtidal muddy plains (M1.8). These mosaics are strongly structured by gradients of water submergence and salinity. Allochthonous subsidies from riverine discharge and marine currents, supplement autochthonous sources of energy and carbon, and contribute to high productivity. Complex multi-faceted trophic relationships reflect the convergence and integration of three contrasting realms, and the resulting niche diversity. Autotrophs include planktonic algae, emergent and submerged aquatic plants, which contribute more to trophic networks through organic detritus than through herbivory. The soft sediments and flowing water are critical to in-sediment fauna dominated by polychaetes and molluscs. Freshwater, estuarine and marine fish and zooplankton are diverse and abundant in the water column. These provide food for large diverse communities of wading and fishing birds, itinerant marine predators and terrestrial scavengers and predators (mammals, reptiles). Virtually all biota have life history and/or movement traits enabling them to exploit the highly dynamic ecosystem structure and disturbance regimes. High rates of turnover in habitat and biotaare expressed at community and ecosystem scales by large fluctuations in the mosaic of patch types that make up deltaic ecosystems.

 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 

River inflows structure the dynamic mosaics of coastal river deltas. Inflows depend on catchment geomorphology and climate, and influence water levels, nutrient input, turbidity (hence light penetration), tidal amplitude, salinity gradients, temperature, dissolved oxygen and organic carbon. Rates of delta aggradation depend on interactions between riverine sedimentation and ocean currents, tides and wave action, which disperse sediment loads. Coastal geomorphology influences depth gradients. These processes result in complex, spatio-temporally variable mosaics of distributary channels, islands, floodplains, mangroves, subtidal mud plains and sand beds. Regimes of floods and storm surges driven by weather events in the river catchment and ocean, respectively, have a profound impact on patch dynamics.

Continental margins where rivers connect the coast to high rainfall catchments, usually with high mountains in their headwaters.
