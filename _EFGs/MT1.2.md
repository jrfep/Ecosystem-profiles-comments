# Ecological traits

Highly productive intertidal environments, defined by their fine particle size (dominated by silts), and fuelled largely by allochthonous production. Benthic diatoms are the key primary producer, although ephemeral intertidal seagrass may occur. Fauna are dominated by deposit-feeding taxa that consume organic matter that accumulates in the fine-grained sediments, and detritivores that feed on wrack (drift algae deposited at the high water mark) and other sources of macro-detritus. Bioturbating and tube-dwelling taxa are key ecosystem engineers; the former oxygenating and mixing the sediments, the latter providing structure to an otherwise sedimentary habitat. Infauna (residing within sediments) are protected from high temperatures and desiccation by the surrounding matrix, and do not display the same marked patterns of zonation as rocky intertidal communities. Many infaunal taxa are soft-bodied. Nevertheless, competition for food resources carried by incoming tides can in some instances lead to intertidal gradients in fauna. Predators include the substantial shorebird populations that forage on infauna at low tide, including migratory species that depend on these systems as stopover sites. Fish, rays, crabs and resident whelks forage at Lugworm bioturbation.

# Key-ecological-drivers

These are depositional environments highly influenced by sediment supply and the balance of erosion and sedimentation. They occur on lower wave energy coastlines with lower slopes and larger intertidal ranges than sandy shorelines, resulting in lower levels of sediment transport and oxygenation by physical processes. In the absence of burrowing taxa, sediments may display low rates of turnover, which may result in a sediment anoxic zone close to the surface. Small particle sizes limit interstitial spaces, further reducing aeration. The depth of the anoxic zone can be a key structuring factor. In contrast to sandy shorelines, they are organically rich, and consequently higher in nutrients. Generally, muddy shorelines are formed from sediments supplied by nearby rivers, often remobilised from the seafloor throughout the tidal cycle.

# Distribution

Muddy shorelines occur along low-energy coastlines, in estuaries and embayments where the velocity of water is so low that the finest particles can settle to the bottom. In warmer regions, muddy shorelines compete with colonising mangroves.

## Map details

The indicative map of Muddy shorelines was based on tidal flats mapped by Murray et al. (2019).
