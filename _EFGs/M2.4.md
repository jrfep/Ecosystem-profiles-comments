# Ecological Traits
 

These deep, open-ocean ecosystems span depths from 3000 to 6000 metres. Autotrophs are absent, and hence energy sources are entirely allochthonous. Particulate organic debris is imported principally from epipelagic horizons (M2.1) and the flux of matter diminishing through the meso- (M2.2) and bathypelagic (M2.3) zones. Food for heterotrophs is therefore very scarce. Due to extreme conditions and limited resources, biodiversity is very low. Total biomass declines exponentially from an average of 0.16 mg C m-3 at 3000 m depth to 0.0058 mg C m-3 at 6000 m. However, there is an order of magnitude variation about the mean due to regional differences in the productivity of surface waters. The truncated trophic networks are dominated by planktonic detritivores, with low densities of gelatinous invertebrates and scavenging and predatory fish. Fauna typically have low metabolic rates and some have internal light organs that produce bioluminescence to attract prey, mates or defend themselves. Vertebrates typically have reduced skeletons and watery tissues to maintain buoyancy. Most of the biota possesses cell membranes with specialised phospholipid composition, intrinsic modifications of proteins and protective osmolytes to optimise protein function at high pressure.

 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 

No light penetrates from the ocean surface to abyssopelagic waters. Nutrient concentrations are very low and recharge is dependent on organic flux and detrital fall from the epipelagic zone. Oxygen concentrations, however, are not limiting to aerobic respiration (mostly 3-7ml.l-1) and are generally recharged through global thermohaline circulation driven by cooling in polar regions. Water temperatures vary from below zero in polar waters up to 3°C in parts of the Atlantic. Hydrostatic pressure is extremely high (300-600 atm). Currents are weak, salinity is stable and there is little spatial heterogeneity in the water column.

# Distribution
 

All oceans and  deepest parts of the Mediterranean Sea  beyond the continental slope, mid-ocean ridges and plateaus between depths of 3000 to 6000m.

Indicative distributions of these marine pelagic ecosystem functional groups were derived from bathymetric spatial data obtained from Becker et al. (2009) using depth range thresholds cited in respective descriptive profiles for each functional group.
