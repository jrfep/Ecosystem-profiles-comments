In boreal and mountainous cold, seasonally snow-prone climates, acid soils support structurally simple forests made up of needle-leaf conifer trees, sometimes with broad-leaf deciduous trees. Large forest trees provide habitat for fungi, mosses and liverworts. Seasonal understorey growth sustains high densities of herbivores such as bear, deer, and a variety of insects, with predators such as lynx, wolves and raptors. Plants and animals survive cold winters through freeze-tolerant organs, hibernation or migratory movements.

### Key Features

Closed to open, evergreen (conifers) or deciduous forests in cold climates with short growth periods, low vascular plant species diversity, but abundant cryptogams.

### Overview of distribution

Cool regions (boreal zone or mountains in temperate or mediterranean regions) of the Northern Hemisphere, limited occurrences in southern South America.
