Cool deserts and semi-deserts occur on cool temperate plains and plateaus in central Eurasia and temperate parts of the Americas from sea level up to 4,000 m. Strong winds and freezing temperatures prevail, with low annual precipitation falling as winter snow or sleet. Productivity is low on infertile sandy and clay soils, often with high salinity. Vegetation comprises a sparse cover of low grasses and dwarf shrubs, interspersed with bare patches, with some areas having only lichens and mosses or no vegetation at all. Fauna includes large nomadic herbivores including antelopes, wild horses and camels, which control composition of vegetation. Predators include raptors, snakes, bears, and cats.

### Key Features

Xeromorphic suffratescent or non-sclerophyll shrublands or grasslands; freezing temperatures in winter low, rainfall offset by reduced evapotranspiration burdon; low diversity and endemism.

### Overview of distribution

Cool temperate plains and plateaus from sea level to 4,000 m elevation in central Eurasia, western North America, and Patagonia. Extreme cold deserts are placed in the polar/alpine biome.
