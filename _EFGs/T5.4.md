# Ecological Traits
 
In these arid systems productivity is limited by both low precipitation and cold temperatures, but varies spatially in response to soil texture, salinity and water table depth. Vegetation cover varies with edaphic conditions from near zero over extensive areas of heavily salinized soils or mobile dunes  to more than 50% in upland grasslands and shrublands, but is generally low in stature (<1m tall). The dominant plants are perennial C3 grasses and xeromorphic suffructescent or non-sclerophyllous perennial shrubs. Dwarf-shrubs, tending to prostrate or cushion forms occur in areas exposed to strong, cold winds. Plant growth occurs mainly during warming spring temperatures after winter soil moisture recharge. Eurasian winter annuals grow rapidly in this period after developing extensive root systems over winter. Diversity and local endemism are low across all taxa relative to other arid ecosystems. Trophic networks are characterised by large nomadic mammalian herbivores. Vertebrate herbivores including antelopes, equines, camelids and lagomorphs are important mediators of shrub-grass dynamics. Grasses become dominant with increasing soil fertility or moisture but may be replaced by shrubs as grazing pressure increases. Fossorial lagomorphs and ominivorous rodents contribute to soil perturbation. Predator populations are sparse but taxonomically diverse. They include raptors, snakes, bears and cats. Biocrusts with cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, fungi, mosses and lichens are prominent on fine-textured substrates and become dominant where it is too cold for vascular plants. They play critical roles in soil stability and water and nutrient availability.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Mean annual precipitation is similar to most warm deserts (<250mm) due to rainshadows and continentality, however, in cool deserts this falls mainly as snow or sleet in winter, rather than rain. Although evapotranspiration is less severe than in hot deserts, a substantial water deficit exists due to low precipitation (mostly 10-50% of evapotranspiration) and strong desiccating winds that may occasionally propagate fires. Mean monthly temperatures may fall below -20°C in winter, freezing the soil surface and exceed 15°C in summer. Substrates vary from stony plains and uplands to extensive dunefields, with mosaics of clay and sandy regolith underpinning landscape-scale heterogeneity. Large regions were submerged below seas or lakes in past geological eras, with internal drainage systems leaving significant legacies of salinity in some lowland areas, especially in clay substrates.

# Distribution
 
Cool temperate plains and plateaus from sea level to 4000m elevation in central Eurasia, western North America, Patagonia. Extreme cold deserts are placed in the polar/alpine biome.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
