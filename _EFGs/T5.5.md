# Ecological Traits
 
Hyper-arid deserts are extremely low productivity and low biomass systems, limited by low precipitation and extreme temperatures. Vegetation cover is very sparse (<1%) and low in stature (typically a few centimetres tall), but productivity and biomass may be marginally greater in topographically complex landscapes within patches of rising ground-water, accumulation of runoff or intersecting cloud cover. Trophic networks are simple because autochthonous productivity and allochthonous resources are very limited. Rates of decomposition are slow and driven by microbial activity UV-B photodegradation, both of which decline with precipitation. Microbial biofilms play important decomposition roles in soils and contain virus lineages that are putatively distinct from other ecosystems. Although diversity is relatively low, endemism may be relatively high because of strong selection pressures and insularity that results from the large extent of these arid regions and limited dispersal abilities of most organisms. Low densities of drought-tolerant perennial plants (xerophytes) characterise these systems. The few perennials have very slow growth and tissue turnover rates, low fecundity, generally long life spans and water acquisition and conservation traits including extensive root systems, thick cuticles, stomatal regulation, succulent organs, etc. Ephemeral plants with long-lived soil seed banks are well represented in hyper-arid deserts characterised by episodic rainfall, but they are less common in those that are largely reliant on fog or groundwater. Fauna include both ruderal and drought-tolerant species. Thermoregulation is strongly represented in reptiles and invertebrates. Birds and large mammals are sparse and nomadic except in areas with reliable standing water. Herbivores and granivores have boom-bust population dynamics coincident with episodic rains.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Extreme rainfall deficit arising from very low rainfall (150mm to almost zero and <5% of potential evapotranspiration), exacerbated by extremely hot temperatures and desiccating winds. Principal sources of moisture may include moisture-laden fog, highly irregular interannual or decadal rainfall events, and capillary rise from deep water tables.  UV-B radiation is extreme except where moderated by fogs. Temperatures exhibit high diurnal and seasonal variability, with extreme summer maxima and sub-zero winter night temperatures. Hyper-arid deserts occur on extensive peneplains and mountainous terrain. Substrates may be extensive sheets of unstable shifting sand or stony gibber with no soil profile development and low levels of nutrients.

We calculated the aridity index (AI, UNEP 1992) using  spatio-temporal series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (Harris et al. 2014), and selected areas of hyper-arid climate (AI<0.05).
