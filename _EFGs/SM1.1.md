# Ecological traits

These systems are bodies of saline or brackish waters with subterranean connections to the sea and limited exposure to open air. Virtually all anchialine biota are marine in origin, hence these caves have a larger and more diverse species pool than underground streams and pools. The trophic network is truncated and dominated by heterotrophs (scavenging and filter-feeding detritivores and their predators), with photosynthetic primary producers and herbivores only present where sinkholes connect caves to the surface and sunlight. Productivity is limited by scarcity of light and food, but less so than insular freshwater subterranean systems (S2.1) due to influx of marine detritus and biota. The biota include planktonic bacteria, protozoans, annelids, crustaceans and fish. A number of these are anchialine obligates that inhabit locations deep within the caves, with marine biota increasing in frequency with proximity to the sea connection. Sponges and hydroids, for example, occur in strongly tidal cave waters. Distinctive traits of the obligates that reflect selection under darkness and food scarcity include varying degrees of eye loss and depigmentation, increased tactile and chemical sensitivity, reproduction with few large eggs, long life spans, slow metabolism and growth rates. Some biota have close relatives in deep ocean systems, including shrimps that retain red pigmentation in both systems.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Anchialine caves derive from seawater penetration into faults, fractures and lava tubes, and sea-level rise into limestone caves formed by solution. Cave waters are characterised by an absence or scarcity of light, low food abundance and strong salinity gradients. Salt concentration increases with depth (often with a sharp halocline boundary), declines horizontally with distance from the sea, and varies with tides and rainfall percolation. Tidal connections result in suck and blow phases of water movement that diminish with increasing stratification of the water column and increasing distance from the sea.  Bedrock porosity influences infiltration of fresh groundwater, and hence salinity gradients. Temperatures are moderate but increase and become less variable with depth. Dissolved oxygen declines with depth.

# Distribution

Scattered worldwide, mostly in the northern hemisphere in limestones, basalt flows and more rarely other lithic substrates.

{% capture map_det %} Indicative distributions of Anchialine caves were based on mapped areas of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016) and lava flows intersecting with the coast. {% endcapture %}
