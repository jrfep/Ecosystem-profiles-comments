# Ecological Traits
 
Treeless mountain systems are dominated variously by grasses, herbs or low shrubs, typically less than 1 m tall. Moderate-low and strictly seasonal productivity is limited by deep winter snowcover, extreme cold and frost during spring thaw, short growing seasons, desiccating winds and in some cases by mass movement. Vegetation is comprises a typically continuous cover of plants (high LAI) including bryophytes, lichens, C3 grasses, sedges, forbs and dwarf shrubs including cushion growth forms. However, the cover of vascular plants may be much lower in low rainfall regions or in sites exposed to strong desiccating winds, and often characterised by dwarf shrubs and lithophytic lichens (e.g. fjaeldmark). Plants have morphological and ecophysiological traits to protect buds, leaves and reproductive tissues from extreme cold, including ramulose growth forms, diminutive leaf sizes, sclerophylly, vegetative propagation, cold-stratification dormancy, etc. The vertebrate fauna includes a few hibernating residents, migratory herbivores and predators that are nomadic or have large home ranges. Aestivating insects include katydids, diptera and hemiptera. Local endemism and beta-diversity may be high due to steep elevational gradients, microhabitat heterogeneity and topographic barriers to dispersal between mountain ranges, with evidence for both facilitation and competition.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Winters are long and cold, while summers are short and mild. Seasonal snow up to several metres deep provides insulation to over-wintering plants and animals. Severe frosts and desiccating winds characterise the spring thaw and exposed ridges and slopes. Severe storms may result from orographic-atmospheric instability. Typically there is a large precipitation surplus, but deficits occur in some regions. Steep elevational gradients, variation in microtopography and aspect promote microclimatic heterogeneity. Steep slopes are subjected to periodic mass movements, which destroy surface vegetation.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
