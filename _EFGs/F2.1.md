# Ecological Traits
 
Large permanent freshwater lakes, generally exceeding 100 km2, are prominent landscape features connected to one or more rivers, either terminally or as flow-through systems. Shoreline complexity, depth, bathymetric stratification and benthic topography promote niche diversity and zonation. High niche diversity, together with large volumes of permanent water and hence large areas of stable connected habitat, supports complex trophic webs typified by high diversity and abundance. Primary productivity may vary seasonally, depending on climate, light availability and nutrient regimes. Autochthonous energy from abundant pelagic algae, particularly diatoms and cyanobacteria, and from benthic macrophytes and algal biofilms (in shallow areas) is supplemented by allochthonous inflows that depend on catchment characteristics, climate, season and hydrological connectivity. Zooplankton, invertebrate consumers and herbivorous fish support upper trophic levels characterised by abundant and diverse predatory fish, amphibians, reptiles, waterbirds and mammals. Obligate freshwater biota in large lakes, including aquatic macrophytes and macroinvertebrates (e.g. crustaceans) and fish, often display high catchment-level endemism. Marked niche differentiation in life history and behavioural feeding traits characterises the most diverse assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fish (e.g. c. 500 cichlid fish species in Lake Victoria). Large predators are critical in top-down regulation of lower trophic levels. Large lake volume buffers against nutrient-mediated change from oligotrophic to eutrophic states. Recruitment of fish and other organisms is strongly influenced by physical processes such as large inflow events. Mobile birds and terrestrial mammals use the lakes as breeding sites and/or sources of drinking water and play key roles in inter-catchment transfers of nutrients, organic matter and dispersal of biota.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Large water volumes influence resource availability, environmental stability (through thermal buffering) and niche diversity. Water is from catchment inflows, which may vary seasonally with climate. Large lakes influence regional climate through evaporation, cooling and convection feedbacks. These processes also influence nutrient availability, along with catchment and lake substrates and stratal mixing, which depends on inflow, depth, wind regimes and seasonal temperature variation. Monomictic stratification may thus occur in deeper lakes. Light varies with lake depth, turbidity, cloud cover and latitude.

Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of rivers and streams were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
