# Ecological traits

Constructed sea walls, breakwaters, piers, docks, tidal canals and other coastal infrastructure create substrates inhabited by inter-tidal and subtidal, benthic and demersal marine biota around ports, harbours and other intensively settled coastal areas. Structurally simple, spatially homogeneous substrates support a cosmopolitan biota, generally with no endemism and lower taxonomic and functional diversity than rocky shores (MT1.1). Trophic networks are relatively simple and dominated by filter feeders (sea squirts and barnacles) and biofilms of benthic algae and bacteria. Low habitat heterogeneity and the small surface area for attachment that the often vertical substrate provides regulate community structure by promoting strong competition and limiting specialised niches such as crevices or pools and restricting refuges from predators. Small planktivorous fishes may dominate temperate harbours and ports. These can provide a trophic link, but overharvest of predatory fish and sharks, may destabilise food webs and cause trophic cascades. Much of the biota possesses traits that promote opportunistic colonisation, including highly dispersive life stages (larvae, eggs, spores), high fecundity, generalist settlement niches and diet, wide ranges of salinity tolerance and rapid population turnover. These structures typically contain a high proportion of non-native species than the natural substrates they replace.

# Key-ecological-drivers

The substrate material influences the texture, chemistry and thermal properties of the surface. Artificial structures of wood, concrete, rock or steel have flat, uniform and vertical surfaces that limit niche diversity and exacerbate the inter-tidal gradients in desiccation and temperature. Ecologically engineered structures have more complex surfaces and ponds to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function.  Structures may be located in high (breakwaters) or low (harbours) energy waters. Tides and waves are key drivers of onshore resource and kinetic energy gradients. Brackish water plumes from polluted stormwater and sewage overflows add allochthonous nutrients and organic carbon, and open ecological space exploited by invasive species introduced by shipping and ballast water. The structures are often located close to vectors for invasive species (e.g. transport hubs). Boat traffic and stormwater outflows cause erosion, bank instability, and maintain high turbidity in the water column. This limits photosynthesis by primary producers, but nutrient run-off may increase planktonic productivity. Maintenance regimes (e.g. regular scraping) reduce biomass and reset succession.
