Permanent marshes occur throughout tropical and temperate regions of the world in flat areas with stable water levels close to the surface. They are essentially treeless, with extensive reedbeds and aquatic grasses, interspersed with patches of open water. Food webs are strongly influenced by highly productive algae and plants, providing food for large numbers of invertebrates, waterbirds, reptiles, and mammals.

### Key Features

Shallow permanently inundated freshwater wetlands, dominated by herbaceous macrophytes, supporting high primary productivity and complex trophic networks with abundant insects, birds and amphibians.

### Overview of distribution

Mainly on floodplains in catchments with humid tropical or temperate climates.
