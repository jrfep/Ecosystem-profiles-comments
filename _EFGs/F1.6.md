# Ecological Traits
 
Intermittent streams have high temporal variability in flows and unpredictable resource availability, characteristics that shape a low diversity biota with periodically high abundance of some organisms. Productivity is intermittently high, punctuated by longer periods of low productivity (boom-bust dynamics). Trophic structure may be complex and dominated by autochthonous primary production, although allochthonous processes from connected floodplains may be important.  Most biota have ruderal life cycles, dormancy phases or high mobility enabling them to exploit short pulses of high resource availability during flooding, and to tolerate long dry intervening periods. Flows and floods initiate rapid breeding and recruitment, enabled by an abundance of water, nutrients and food. During dry periods, organisms survive as dormant life phases (e.g.  eggs, seeds), by reducing metabolism, by persisting in perennial refugia (e.g.  waterholes, shallow aquifers), or by movement elsewhere (e.g.  waterbirds). Organisms generally tolerate wide ranges of temperature, salinity and oxygen. Pelagic micro-invertebrates (zooplankton) are abundant, while macro-invertebrates such as sessile filter feeders (e.g.  mussels) and scavengers (e.g.  crayfish) may occur in moderate flow environments associated with structurally complex micro-habitats in fine sediment and amongst fallen woody debris.  Fish communities are dominated by small body sizes.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These systems are distinguished by highly episodic flows and flood regimes. Long dry periods are punctuated by high-volume flows of short duration (days to weeks, rarely months) which fill channels and flood other wetlands. Low gradients (typically <5°) result in low turbulence, and low to moderate flow velocity. Episodically high flow volumes depend on catchment size and precipitation. Overbank flows occur periodically. Lowland stream channels are broad, flat, sometimes deep and often anastomising, with mostly soft sandy sediments. Groundwater is typically within the rooting zone of perennial plants, which may establish in channels after flow events. Dominant depositional sedimentary processes generate periodically high turbidity. Locally or temporally important erosional processes have a role in sediment redistribution and geomorphic dynamism of depositional features (e.g.  braided channels, point bars). Upland streams are prone to erosive flash floods. Nutrient levels are relatively high due to large catchment areas and riparian inputs, but depend on catchment geochemistry. These rivers often flow over naturally saline soils and so salinity can be high, increasing in drying phases.

# Distribution
 
Throughout the world in arid and semi-arid mid latitudes, lowlands and uplands, but rarely above 1500m.

{% capture map_det %}
The distribution of Episodic arid rivers was estimated using a global river environmental stratification database (Ouellet Dallaire et al. 2018). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>25%) and minor occurrences (< 25%) .
