# Ecological Traits
 
Lowland rivers are usually productive environments and often have complex trophic webs. Primary production is mostly autochthonous, but allochthonous inputs from floodplains and upper catchments and can be very important.  The biota tolerates a wide range of temperature and oxygen concentrations. Planktonic and filamentous algae are major primary producers and macrophytes may be conspicuous on river margins and benches. Zooplankton are abundant, while sessile (e.g.  mussels) and scavenging (e.g.  crayfish) macro-invertebrates are associated with structurally complex microhabitats in moderate flow environments, including fine sediment and woody debris.  Fish communities are diverse and contribute to complex trophic networks. They include large predatory fish (e.g.  sturgeons) smaller predators of invertebrates, herbivores and detritivores. The feeding activities and movement of piscivorous  birds (e.g.  cormorants),  mammals (e.g.  otters) and reptiles (e.g.  turtles) extend the trophic network beyond the instream waters. Riparian zones vary in complexity from forested banks to shallow areas where emergent vegetation grows (e.g.  reeds, macrophytes) . Intermittently connected oxbow lakes or billabongs can increase the complexity of associated habitats, providing more lentic waters for a range of different aquatic fauna and flora.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These rivers are distinguished by shallow gradients (typically <2°), with low turbulence, low to moderate flow velocity and high to very high flow volumes which are continuous, but may vary seasonally, depending on catchment area and precipitation. This combination of features is most common at low altitudes within 200 m of sea level and rarely occurs above 1500m. River channels are wide and sometimes deep, with mostly soft sediment substrates. They are dominated by depositional processes, and so turbidity may be high, at least periodically. Overbank flows increase turbulence and turbidity. Locally or temporally important erosional processes have a role in sediment redistribution and geomorphic dynamism of depositional features (e.g. braided channels, point bars). Nutrient levels are relatively high due to large catchments and riparian/floodplain inputs, but depend on catchment geochemistry. Oxygen and temperatures vary with climate and catchment features. For catchments with extensive peatlands, waters may be tannin-rich, poorly oxygenated, acidic and dark, reducing productivity.

# Distribution
 
Permanent lowland rivers are distributed throughout tropical and temperate lowlands, very uncommon in arid subtropical –warm temperate zones and absent from boreal zones.

{% capture map_det %}
Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of rivers and streams were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
