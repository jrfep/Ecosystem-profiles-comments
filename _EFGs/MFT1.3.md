# Ecological traits

Coastal saltmarshes are vegetated by salt-tolerant forbs, grasses and shrubs, with fine-scale mosaics related to strong local hydrological and salinity gradients. Plant traits such as succulence, salt excretion, osmotic and ionic regulation, reduced transpiration, C4 photosynthesis (among grasses), modular growth forms and aerenchymatous tissues confer varied degrees of tolerance to salinity, desiccation and substrate anoxia. Adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems influence complexity and function of the trophic network, while freshwater inputs mediate resource availability and physiological stress. Angiosperms are structurally dominant autotrophs, but algal mats and phytoplankton imported by tidal waters make major contributions to primary production. Cyanobacteria and rhizobial bacteria are important N-fixers. Tides and runoff bring subsidies of organic detritus and inorganic nutrients (including nitrates) from marine and terrestrial sources, respectively. Nitrogen is imported into saltmarshes mainly as inorganic forms, and exported largely as organic forms, providing important subsidies to trophic networks of adjacent estuarine fish nurseries (FM1.2). Fungi and bacteria decompose dissolved and particulate organic matter, while sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in decay of the substantial biomass in the anaerobic subsoil. Protozoans consume microbial decomposers, while in situ detritivores and herbivores include a range of crustacea, polychaetes and molluscs. Many of these ingest a mixture of organic material and sediment, structuring, aerating and increasing micro-scale heterogeneity of the substrate with burrows and faecal pellets. Fish move through saltmarsh vegetation at high tide, feeding mainly on algae. They include small-bodied residents and juveniles of larger species that move offshore when mature. Itinerant terrestrial mammals consume higher plants, regulating competition and vegetation structure. Saltmarshes also provide breeding and/or foraging sites for colonial and solitary shorebirds, including migratory species that play important roles in dispersal of plants, invertebrates and microbes.

# Key-ecological-drivers

High and variable salt concentration is driven by alternating episodes of soil desiccation and flushing, associated with cycles of tidal inundation and drying combined with freshwater seepage, rainfall and runoff in the upper intertidal zone. These interacting processes produce dynamic fine-scale hydrological and salinity gradients, which may drive transformation to intertidal forest (MFT1.2). Marshes are usually associated with low-energy depositional coasts, but may occur on sea cliffs and headlands where wind deposits salt from wave splash (saltspray) and aerosol inputs. Salt approaches hypersaline levels when flushing events are separated by long intervals of desiccation. Other essential nutrients are present as a low proportion of the total ionic content. Subsoils are generally anaerobic, but this varies depending on seepage water and the frequency of tidal inundation. Tidal cycles also influence temperature extremes, irregularity in photoperiod, mechanical disturbance and deposition of sediment over vegetation.
