# Ecological Traits
 
Fens are peatland ecosystems dominated by hydrophytic grasses, sedges or forbs. Fens have higher productivity, but lower functional diversity than bogs (TF1.6). Productivity is subsidised by inflow of minerotrophic waters and limited by anoxic substrates. Plant diversity is very low where surface hydrology varies temporally from complete saturation to desiccation, but can be high in mineral-rich fens with stable near-surface water tables. Some regions are rich in locally endemic flora and fauna. Woody plants are typically scarce or absent, though some boreal forests (T2.1) develop on minerotrophic peats. Sphagnum mosses and hummock-forming sedges are absent from rich fens but ‘brown mosses’ are common. Primary production is partly broken down on the soil surface layers by anamorphic fungi and aerobic bacteria. Anaerobic conditions due to high water tables limit subsurface microbial activity, so that organic deposition exceeds decomposition and peat (partially decayed remains of plants) accumulates. Plant traits such as lacunate stem tissues, aerenchyma and surface root mats promote oxygen transport into the anaerobic substrate. Methanogenic archaea and anaerobic bacteria may occur in the subsoil if nitrogen, iron and sulphur are sufficient to sustain them. Fens may be spatially homogeneous or form string mosaics with bogs, but often display zonation reflecting differences in water chemistry (notably pH) or saturation, and patches of fen and bogs may be juxtaposed within peatland mosaics. Ongoing peat build-up may lead to transition from fen to bog systems. Plants and fungi reproduce locally by cloning, but seed and spore production enables dispersal and colonisation of new sites. Invertebrates are dominant consumers in the trophic network. Larval dragonflies, dipterans and lepidopterans are prominent herbivores, while adults are pollinators and predators. Vertebrates are mostly itinerant, but include specialised resident amphibians and birds.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Moisture inputs (precipitation, seepage and surface inflow) exceed outputs (evapotranspiration, percolation, run-off) for extended periods, enabling these systems to function as landscape sponges. Seasonally low temperatures and/or frequent cloud cover limit evapotranspiration. Fens typically develop by paludification of shallow lakes or around springs and thus shallow standing water is frequently present. Such lakes may be abundant in post-glacial landscapes. Substrates are waterlogged, anaerobic, highly organic (usually >30% dry weight), slightly acidic or alkaline and rich in mineral nutrients. Minerotrophic water (inflow from catchments) provides significant nutrient subsidies that vary with catchment geology. Fires rarely occur.

# Distribution
 
Extensive across boreal-subarctic latitudes and cool temperate regions, especially mountains. Very restricted in the southern hemisphere.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
