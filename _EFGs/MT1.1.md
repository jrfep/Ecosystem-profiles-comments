# Ecological traits

These intertidal benthic systems, composed of sessile and mobile species, are highly structured by fine-scale resource- and stress-gradients, as well as trade-offs between competitive, facilitation and predatory interactions. Sessile algae and invertebrates, may form complex 3-dimensional habitats that provide microhabitat refugia to associated organisms from desiccation and temperature stress, and weaken competitive interactions. The biota exhibit behavioural and morphological adaptions to minimise exposure to stressors, such as seeking shelter in protective microhabitats at low tide, and possessing exoskeletons (e.g. shells) or producing mucous to reduce desiccation. Morphologies reflect adaptation to a wave-swept environment (i.e. small body sizes and cross-sectional areas to minimise drag). Key trophic groups include filter feeders, which feed on phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter at high tide, grazers which scrape microphytobenthos and macroalgal spores from rock, or consume macroalgal thalli, as well as resident (e.g. starfish, whelks, crabs) and transient (e.g. birds, fishes) marine and terrestrial predators. Rocky shores display high endemism relative to other coastal systems, and frequently display high productivity due to the large amounts of light they receive, although this can vary according to nutrient availability from upwelling.

# Key-ecological-drivers

 Tides and waves are the key ecological drivers, producing resource availability and physical disturbance gradients vertically and horizontally, respectively. Across the vertical gradient of increasing aerial exposure, desiccation and temperature stress increases, time available for filter feeding decreases, and interactions with marine/terrestrial predators vary. The horizontal gradient of diminishing wave exposure from headlands to bays or inlets influences community composition and morphology. Many organisms rely on microhabitats formed from natural rock features (eg. crevices, depressions, rockpools) or habitat-forming species (e.g. canopy forming algae, mussels and oysters, barnacles) to persist in an environment that would otherwise exceed their environmental tolerances. Rocky shores are open systems and community structure can be influenced by larval supply, coastal upwelling, and also competition. Competition for space may limit the lower vertical distributions of some sessile species. Additionally, the limited space available for growth of marine primary producers can result in competition for food among grazers. Disturbances (i.e. storms) that free space can have a strong influence on community structure and diversity.

# Distribution

Found globally at the margins of oceans, where waves have eroded softer rocks leaving only harder rocks. They are the most common ecosystems on open high-energy coasts and also occur on many sheltered and enclosed coastlines, such as sea lochs, fjords and rias.

## Map details

Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) containing Rocky shorelines, Sandy shorelines and Boulder and cobble shorelines were identified by consulting regional substrate maps and expertise of authors. These were clipped to the extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
