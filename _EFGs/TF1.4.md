# Ecological traits


These high productivity floodplain wetlands are fed regularly by large inputs of allochthonous resources that drive strong bottom-up regulation. Functionally diverse autotrophs include phytoplankton, algal mats and epiphytes, floating and amphibious herbs and graminoids, and semi-terrestrial woody plants. Interactions of fine-scale spatial gradients in anoxia and desiccation are related to differential flooding. These gradients shape ecosystem assembly by enabling species with diverse life history traits to exploit different niches, resulting in strong local zonation of vegetation and high patch-level diversity of habitats for consumers. Wetland mosaics include very productive and often extensive non-woody vegetation that persists through dry seasons as dormant seeds or subterranean organs, and groves of woody perennials that are less tolerant of prolonged anoxia but access ground water or arrest growth during dry phases. The productive and functionally diverse autotrophs support complex trophic networks with zooplankton, crustacea, insects, amphibians, reptiles, waterbirds and terrestrial birds and mammals with diverse dietary and foraging strategies. During dry phases, obligate aquatic organisms are confined to wet refugia, and possess traits that promote tolerance to low water quality and predator avoidance. Others, including many invertebrates, have dormancy traits allowing persistence as e.g. during dry phases. Very high abundances and diversity of waterbirds, reptiles and mammals exploit resource availability, particularly when prey are concentrated during draw down phases of flooding. Reproduction and recruitment coincide with food availability, cued by flood regimes.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Regular seasonal flooding is driven by the river flow regimes, reflecting seasonal precipitation or melt  patterns in catchments that may be considerable distances away. Flood extent and duration varies interannually, especially in temperate zones. Geomorphic heterogeneity in the depositional floodplains promote spatial and temporal variability in moisture status, creating contrasting patches including perennially inundated refuges and dry ‘islands’ that seldom flood and dry rapidly. Substrates are fertile alluvium with variable grain sizes, moisture and organic content that reflect fine-scale depositional patterns and hydrological gradients. Flooding often occurs in spring or summer, combining with warming temperatures and light to maximise primary and secondary productivity.  Wild fires may occur in dry seasons, releasing resources and affecting structure and composition of vegetation.

## Map details

Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of Seasonal floodplain marshes and Episodic arid floodplains were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
