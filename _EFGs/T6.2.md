# Ecosystem properties

Low biomass systems with very low productivity constrained by extreme cold, desiccating winds, skeletal substrates, periodic mass movement, and, in polar regions, by seasonally low light intensity. The dominant lifeforms are freeze-tolerant crustose lichens, mosses, and algae that also tolerate periodic desiccation, invertebrates such as tardigrades, nematodes, and mites, micro-organisms including bacteria and protozoa, and nesting birds that forage primarily in other (mostly marine) ecosystems. Diversity and endemism are low, likely due to intense selection pressures and wide dispersal. Trophic networks are simple and truncated. Physiological traits such as cold-adapted enzymes and cold-shock proteins enable metabolic activity, which is restricted to summer months when temperatures are close to or above zero. Nutrient input occurs primarily through substrate weathering supplemented by guano, which along with cyanobacteria is a major source of N. Mass movement of snow and rock, with accumulation of snow and ice during the intervals between collapse events, promotes disequilibrium ecosystem dynamics.

# Ecological Drivers

Extremely cold winters with wind-chill that may reduce temperatures below −80°C in Antarctica. In contrast, insolation and heat absorption on rocky substrates may increase summer temperatures well above 0°C. Together with the impermeable substrate and intermittently high winds, exposure to summer insolation may produce periods of extreme water deficit punctuated by saturated conditions associated with meltwater and seepage. Periodic burial by snow reduces light availability, while mass movement through landslides, avalanches, or volcanic eruptions maintain substrate instability and destroy biomass, limiting the persistence of biota.
