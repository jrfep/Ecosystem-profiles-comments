Polar-alpine rocky outcrops occur in permanently ice-free areas of polar regions and high mountains. Productivity and biomass are limited by extreme cold, rocky substrate and strong winds. Algae, lichens, mosses and bacteria support a short and simple foodweb in the summer months, with cold-tolerant invertebrates such as tardigrades. Some rocky sites provide nesting sites for birds in summer. Substrate weathering and guano are major nutrient inputs. These systems are periodically disturbed as accumulated snow and ice collapses down steep slopes.

### Key Features

Environments free of permanent ice where extreme cold, winds, skeletal substrates and periodic mass movement limit biota to cryptogams, invertebrates and microorganisms, nesting birds may occur..

### Overview of distribution

Permanently ice-free areas of Antarctica,  Greenland, the Arctic Circle, and high mountains in the western  Americas, central Asia, Europe, Africa and New Zealand..
