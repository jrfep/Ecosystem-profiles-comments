# Ecological Traits
 
These deployments include submerged structures with high vertical relief including ship wrecks, oil and gas infrastructure, and designed artificial reefs, as well as some low relief structures (e.g. rubble piles). The latter do not differ greatly from adjacent natural reefs, but structures with high vertical relief are distinguished by an abundance of zooplanktivorous fish. Macroalgae are sparse or absent as the ecosystem is fed by currents and ocean swell delivering phytoplankton to sessile invertebrates. Complex surfaces quickly thicken with a biofouling community characterised by an abundance of filter feeding invertebrates (sponges, barnacles, bivalves and ascidians) and their predators (crabs, flatworms). Invertebrate diversity is high, with representatives from every living phylum. Structures without complex surfaces, such as the smooth wide expanse of a hull, may suffer sporadic and catastrophic loss of all biofouling communities after storm events. This feeds the sandy bottom community, evident as a halo of benthic invertebrates (polychaetes, amphipods), which also benefit from the plume of faeces and detritus drifting down from the reef’s community.  Artificial structures also provide a visual focus attracting occasional pelagic fish and marine mammals, which respond similarly to towards fish attraction devices (FADs) and drift objects.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
High vertical relief of artificial structures enables biota access to currents, which continuously transport plankton to the benthos and schools of zooplanktivorous fish. They may be situated on otherwise flat, soft-bottom habitats and isolated to varying degrees from other hard substrates. High energy waters experience low variation in temperature and salinity (except those near major river systems). Currents and associated eddies cause strong horizontal flow, while ocean swell creates orbital current velocities at least 10 fold greater than horizontal currents. Near large urban centres, fishing reduces populations of large predatory fish resulting in a continuum across species and deployments from purely fish attraction to fish production (such as via the reef facilitating the planktivororous food chain). The historical use of materials of opportunity (rubber tyres, construction material or inadequately decommissioned vessels) have left legacies of pollutants.

# Distribution
 
Millions of artificial reefs and FADs are deployed in coastal waters throughout the world, mostly in tropical and temperate regions. In the Asia-Pacific alone, over 600 oil and gas projects are expected to be decommissioned in the next decade, and may be left as artificial reefs.  Worldwide, since 1984 over 130 ships and planes have purposely been sunk as dive wrecks for the SCUBA diving industry.

Marine ecoregions that include occurrences of Submerged artificial structures (M4.1) were identified by overlaying a mapped distribution of shipwrecks (Monfils 2004) on marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008). To represent uncertainty, indicative distributions were mapped in yellow.
