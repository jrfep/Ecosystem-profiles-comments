# Ecosystem properties

Arid systems dominated by hard-leaved (sclerophyll) vegetation have relatively high diversity and local endemism, notably among plants, reptiles, and small mammals. Large moisture deficits and extremely low levels of soil nutrients limit productivity, however, infrequent episodes of high rainfall drive spikes of productivity and boom-bust ecology. Spatial heterogeneity is also critical in sustaining diversity by promoting niche diversity and resource-rich refuges during ‘bust’ intervals. Stress-tolerator and ruderal life-history types are strongly represented in both flora and fauna. Perennial, long-lived, slow-growing, drought-tolerant, sclerophyll shrubs and hummock (C4) grasses structure the ecosystem by stabilising soils, acting as nutrient-accumulation sites and providing continuously available habitat, shade, and food for fauna. Strong filtering by both nutritional poverty and water deficit promote distinctive scleromorphic and xeromorphic plant traits. They include low SLA, high C:N ratios, reduced foliage, stomatal regulation and encryption, slow growth and reproduction rates, deep root systems, and trait plasticity. Perennial succulents are absent. Episodic rains initiate emergence of a prominent ephemeral flora, with summer and winter rains favouring grasses and forbs, respectively. This productivity ‘boom’ triggers rapid responses by granivores and their predators. Herbivore populations also fluctuate but less so due to ecophysiological traits that promote water conservation. Abundant detritivores support a diverse and abundant resident reptilian and small-mammal fauna. Small mammals and some macro-invertebrates are nocturnal and fossorial, with digging activity contributing to nutrient and carbon cycling, as well as plant recruitment. The abundance and diversity of top predators is low. Nomadism and ground-nesting are well represented in birds. Periodic fires reduce biomass, promote recovery traits in plants (e.g. re-sprouting and fire-cued recruitment) and initiate successional processes in both flora and fauna.

# Ecological Drivers

Resource availability is limited by a large overall water deficit (rainfall <250 mm p.a., 5–50% of potential evapotranspiration) and acid sandy soils with very low P and N, together with high diurnal and seasonal variation in temperatures. Summers have runs of extremely hot days (>40°C) and winters have cool nights (0°C), rarely with snow. Long dry spells are punctuated by infrequent inter-annual pulses of water surplus, driving ecological booms and transient periods of fuel continuity. Fires occur at decadal- or century-scale return intervals when lightning or human ignitions coincide with fuel continuity.
