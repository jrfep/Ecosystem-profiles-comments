# Ecological traits

The mesopelagic, dysphotic, or ‘twilight’ zone begins below the epipelagic layer, and receives just enough light to discern diurnal cycles, but too little for photosynthesis. The trophic network is therefore dominated by detritivores and predators, and the diverse organisms within this layer consume and reprocess allochthonous organic material sinking from the upper, photosynthetic layer. Hence upper mesopelagic waters include layers of concentrated plankton, bacteria and other organic matter sinking from the more diverse and heterogeneous epipelagic zone (M2.1). Consumers of this material deplete oxygen levels in the mesopelagic zone, more so than in other layers where oxygen can be replenished via diffusion and mixing at the surface or photosynthesis (epipelagic zone), or where lower nutrient levels limit biological processes (deeper layers). All species undertake diel vertical migration into the epipelagic zone during the night to feed when predation risk is lower. These organisms use the mesopelagic zone as a refuge during the day and increase the flow of carbon between ocean layers. Bioluminescence is a common trait, present in more than 90% of mesopelagic organisms (e.g., Myctophidae, lantern fish). Fish in the lower mesopelagic zone (> 700 m) are less reflective and mobile due to reduced selection pressure from visual predators in low light conditions. These systems are difficult to sample, but advances in estimating fish abundance indicate that biomass is very high, possibly two orders of magnitude larger than global fisheries landings (1 × 1010t). 

# Key-ecological-drivers

 Nutrient and energy availability depend on allochthonous fluxes of carbon from the upper ocean. Energy assimilation directly from sunlight is negligible. This is characteristically episodic and linked to events in the epipelagic zone. Buffered from surface forcing by epipelagic waters, the mesopelagic zone is less spatially and temporally variable, but the interface between the two zones is characterised by heterogeneous regions with greater biotic diversity. Areas of physicochemical discontinuity (e.g., current and water mass boundaries, eddies) also result in niche habitats with increased local diversity. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are formed in mesopelagic waters when biological activity reduces oxygen levels in a water mass that is then restricted from mixing by physical processes or features. OMZs support specialised biota and have high levels of biological activity around their borders.

# Distribution

Global oceans from a depth of approximately 200 m, or where < 1% of light penetrates, down to 1000 m.

## Map details

Indicative distributions of these marine pelagic ecosystem functional groups were derived from bathymetric spatial data obtained from Becker et al. (2009) using depth range thresholds cited in respective descriptive profiles for each functional group.
