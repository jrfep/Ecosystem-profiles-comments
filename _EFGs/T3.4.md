# Ecosystem properties

Vegetation dominated by cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes) develops on skeletal rocky substrates and may have scattered shrubs with very low LAI. These low-productivity systems are limited by moisture and nutrient scarcity, temperature extremes, and periodic disturbance through mass movement. Diversity and endemism is low across taxa and the trophic structure is simple. Reptiles and ground-nesting birds are among the few resident vertebrates. Lichens and bryophytes may be abundant and perform critical roles in moisture retention, nutrient acquisition, energy capture, surface stabilisation, and proto-soil development, especially through carbon accumulation. N-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria, nurse plants, and other mutualisms are critical to ecosystem development. Rates of ecosystem development are linked to substrate weathering, decomposition, and soil development, which mediate nutrient supply, moisture retention, and temperature amelioration. Vascular plants have nanophyll-microphyll leaves and low SLA. Their cover is sparse and comprises ruderal pioneer species (shrubs, grasses, and forbs) that colonise exposed surfaces and extract moisture from rock crevices. Species composition and vegetation structure are dynamic in response to surface instability and show limited differentiation across environmental gradients and microsites due to successional development, episodes of desiccation, and periodic disturbances that destroy biomass. Rates of vegetation development, soil accumulation, and compositional change display amplified temperature-dependence due to resource-concentration effects. Older rocky systems have greater micro-habitat diversity, more insular biota, and higher endemism and are classified in other functional groups.

# Ecological Drivers

Skeletal substrates (e.g. lava pavements, scree slopes, and rock outcrops) limit water retention and nutrient capital and increase heat absorption, leading to periodically extreme temperatures. High summer temperatures and solar exposure concentrate resources and increase the temperature-sensitivity of biogeochemical processes. Winter temperatures may be cold at high elevations (see T6.2). Recurring geophysical disturbances such as lava flow, mass movement, and geothermal activity as well as desiccation episodes periodically destroy biomass and reset successional pathways.
