# Ecological traits

Lichen and shrub-dominated vegetation with very low LAI develops on skeletal rocky substrates. These low-productivity systems are limited by moisture and nutrient scarcity, temperature extremes and periodic disturbance. Diversity and endemism is low across taxa and trophic structure is simple, with few resident vertebrates except reptiles. Lichens and bryophytes may be abundant and perform critical roles in moisture retention, nutrient acquisition, energy capture and surface stabilisation. N-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria, nurse plants and other mutualisms are critical to ecosystem development. Rates of ecosystem development are linked to substrate weathering, decomposition and soil development, which mediate nutrient supply and moisture retention and temperature amelioration. Vascular plants have nanophyll-microphyll leaves and typically low SLA. Their cover is sparse and comprises ruderal 'pioneer' species (shrubs, grasses and forbs) able to colonise exposed surface and extract moisture from rock crevices. Species composition and vegetation structure is unstable and shows limited differentiation across environmental gradients and microsites due to successional development, episodes of desiccation and periodic disturbances that destroy biomass. Rates of vegetation development, soil accumulation and compositional change display amplified temperature dependence due to resource concentration effects.  Older rocky systems have greater micro-habitat diversity, more insular biota and higher endemism and are classified in other functional groups.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Skeletal substrates (e.g. lava pavements, scree slopes, rock outcrops) limit water retention and nutrient capital and increase heat absorption leading to periodically extreme temperatures. Winter temperatures may be cold at high elevation (see also T6.2). High summer temperatures, however, concentrate resources and inflate temperature-sensitivity of biogeochemical processes. Recurring geophysical disturbances such as lava flow, mass movement, geothermal activity, as well as desiccation episodes periodically destroy biomass and reset successional pathways.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
