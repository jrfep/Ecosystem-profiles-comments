These very large rivers transport massive volumes of freshwater (>10,000m<sup>3</sup>/s) through flat lowlands, mostly in tropical or subtropical regions. Their very large flow volumes, diverse habitats and slow to moderate flows make them highly productive. High nutrient levels come from upstream catchments and floodplains, with additional productivity contributed by in-channel algae and aquatic plants. Their food webs are complex, with a high diversity of plants and animals, including large-bodied fish, reptiles and mammals.

### Key Features

Large highly productive rivers with megaflow rates and complex food webs, reflecting the extent of habitat, connections with floodplains and available niches for plants, invertebrates and large vertebrates including aquatic mammals..

### Distribution

Tropical and subtropical lowlands, with some in temperate regions with large catchments topped by wet mountain ranges.
