# Short description

Oceanic cool temperate rainforests have evergreen or semi-deciduous, small-leaved trees, with conifers in some regions. These forests occupy a cooler, wetter climate than warm temperate forests (T2.4), but ocean influence promotes very high precipitation and limits persistence of winter snow (compared with T2.1 or T2.2). Tree diversity is low, but abundant epiphytic and terrestrial mosses and liverworts, ferns, lichens, and conspicuous fungi contribute to seasonal productivity. Foodwebs are simple, with low vertebrate diversity and fewer large herbivores and predators than T2.1 and T2.2, but with many species found nowhere else.

# Key Features

Closed canopy evergreen or semi-deciduous forests in cool wet climates, high endemism with low tree diversity and abundant epiphytes

# Distribution

Cool temperate coasts of Chile, Patagonia, New Zealand, Tasmania and Pacific Northwest
