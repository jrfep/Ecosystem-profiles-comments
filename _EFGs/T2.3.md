# Ecological traits

Broadleaf and needleleaf rainforests in cool temperate climates have evergreen or semi-deciduous tree canopies with high LAI and mostly nanophyll-microphyll foliage. Productivity is moderate to relatively high and constrained by strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology, and moderate levels of frost tolerance. Nonetheless, energy sources are primarily autochthonous. SLA may be relatively high, but lower than in T2.2. Evergreen trees typically dominate, but deciduous species become more abundant in sites prone to more severe frost and/or with high soil fertility and moisture surplus. Local or regional endemism is significant in many taxa. Trophic networks are less complex than in other cool temperate or boreal forests (T2.1, T2.2), with weaker top-down regulation due to the lower diversity and abundance of large herbivores and predators. Tree diversity is low (usually <8-10 spp/ha), with abundant epiphytic and terrestrial bryophytes, pteridophytes, lichens, a modest herbaceous ground flora and conspicuous fungi, which are important decomposers. The vertebrate fauna is mostly sedentary and of low-moderate diversity. Most plants are able to recruit in shade and some remain in seedling banks until gap-phase dynamics is driven by individual tree-fall, lightning strikes or by extreme wind storms in some areas. Tree recruitment varies with tree masting events, which strongly influence trophic dynamics, especially of rodents and their predators.

# Key-ecological-drivers

There is a large overall water surplus, rarely with summer deficits. Rainfall is seasonal, borne on westerly winds peaking in winter months and inter-annual variability is relatively low. Cool winters (minima typically below 0-5°C for 3 months) limit the duration of the growing season. Maritime air masses are the major supply of climatic moisture and moderate winters and summer temperatures. Light may be limited in winter by frequent cloud cover and high latitude. Intermittent winter snow does not persist for more than a few days or weeks. Soils are moderately fertile to infertile and may accumulate peat.  Exposure to winter storms and landslides leaves imprints on forest structure in some regions. Fires are rare, occurring on century time scales when lightning (or human) ignitions follow extended droughts.

# Distribution

Cool temperate coasts of Chile and Patagonia, New Zealand, Tasmania and Pacific northwest, rarely extending to warm temperate latitudes on mountains in Chile, southeast Australia and outliers above 2500 m elevation in the New Guinea highlands. Some authors extend the concept to wet boreal forests on coasts of northwest Europe, Japan and northeast Canada.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
