# Ecological traits

These moderate-productivity, mostly evergreen shrublands and low open forests (generally <6 m tall) are limited by nutritional poverty and strong seasonal drought in the tropical ‘winter’ months. Taxonomic and functional diversity is moderate in most groups, but with high local endemism in plants, invertebrates, birds and some other taxa. Vegetation is spatially heterogeneous, in matrix of savannas (T4.2) or tropical dry forests (T1.2), and dominated by sclerophyllous shrubs with small leaf sizes (nanophyll-microphyll) and low SLA. C4 grasses may be conspicuous (unlike most temperate heathlands T3.2) but generally do not form a continuous stratum as in savanna (T4). These systems have relatively simple trophic networks fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Productivity is low-moderate and constrained by seasonal drought and nutritional poverty. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and possess traits promoting capture and conservation of nutrients (sclerophylly, cluster roots, carnivorous structures, microbial and fungal root mutualisms), and tolerance of severe seasonal droughts (e.g. stomatal invagination). Nectarivorous and/or insectivorous birds reptiles and granivorous small mammals dominate the vertebrate fauna but vertebrate herbivores are sparse. Recurring fires play a role in top-down regulation of ecosystem structure and composition.

# Key-ecological-drivers

A severe seasonal climatic water deficit during tropical 'winter' months is exacerbated by sandy or shallow rocky substrates with low moisture retention. Nutritional poverty (especially N, also P) is associated with oligotrophic, typically acid substrates such as sandstones, ironstones, leached sand deposits, or else rocky volcanic or ultramafic substrates. Vegetation holds the largest pool of nutrients. Temperatures are warm, rarely falling below 10°C, with low diurnal and seasonal variation. Dry season fires recur on decadal or longer time scales, but they are rare in the tepui.

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
