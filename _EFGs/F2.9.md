# Ecosystem properties

These hot springs, geysers, mud pots and associated wetlands result from interactions of deeply circulating groundwater with magma and hot rocks that produce chemically precipitated substrates. They support a specialised but low-diversity biota structured by extreme thermal and geochemical gradients. Energy is almost entirely autochthonous, productivity is low, and trophic networks are very simple. Primary producers include chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea, as well as photoautotrophic cyanobacteria, diatoms, algae, and macrophytes. Thermophilic and metallophilic microbes dominate the most extreme environments in vent pools, while mat-forming green algae and animal-protists occur in warm acidic waters. Thermophilic blue-green algae reach optimum growth above 45°C. Diatoms occur in less acidic warm waters. Aquatic macrophytes occur on sinter aprons and wetlands with temperatures below 35°C. Herbivores are scarce, allowing thick algal mats to develop. These are inhabited by invertebrate detritivores, notably dipterans and coleopterans, which may tolerate temperatures up to 55°C. Molluscs and crustaceans occupy less extreme microhabitats (notably in hard water hot springs), as do vertebrates such as amphibians, fish, snakes and visiting birds. Microinvertebrates such as rotifers and ostracods are common. Invertebrates, snakes and fish exhibit some endemism due to habitat insularity. Specialised physiological traits enabling metabolic function in extreme temperatures include thermophilic proteins with short amino-acid lengths, chaperone molecules that assist protein folding, branched chain fatty acids and polyamines for membrane stabilisation, DNA repair systems, and upregulated glycolysis providing energy to regulate heat stress. Three mechanisms enable metabolic function in extremely acidic (pH<3) geothermal waters: proton efflux via active transport pumps that counter proton influx, decreased permeability of cell membranes to suppress proton entry into the cytoplasm, and strong protein and DNA repair systems. Similar mechanisms enable metabolic function in waters with high concentrations of metal toxins. A succession of animal and plant communities occur with distance from the spring source as temperatures cool and minerals precipitate.

# Ecological Drivers

Continual flows of geothermal groundwater sustain these polymicitic water bodies. Permanent surface waters may be clear or highly turbid with suspended solids as in ‘mud volcanoes’. Water temperatures vary from hot (>44°C) to extreme (>80°C) on local gradients (e.g. vent pools, geysers, mounds, sinter aprons, terraces, and outflow streams). The pH is either extremely acid (2–4) or neutral-alkaline (7–11). Mineral salts are concentrated, but composition varies greatly among sites with properties of the underlying bedrock. Dissolved and precipitated minerals include very high concentrations of silicon, calcium or iron, but also arsenic, antimony, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, polonium or mercury, usually as oxides, sulphides, or sulphates, but nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus may be scarce.

# Distribution

Tectonically or volcanically active areas from tropical to subpolar latitudes. Notable examples in Yellowstone (USA), Iceland, New Zealand, Atacama (Chile), Japan and east Africa.
