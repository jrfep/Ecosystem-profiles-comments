# Ecological traits

 These hot springs, mud pots and geysers result from permanent interaction of groundwater with magma and hot igneous rocks. They support a specialised but low-diversity biota structured by extreme thermal and geochemical gradients. Energy is almost entirely autochthonous, productivity is low and trophic networks are very simple. Thermophilic and metallophilic microbes dominate the most extreme environments in vent pools, while filamentous green algae occur in warm acidic waters, diatoms occur in less acidic warm waters and aquatic macrophytes occur on sinter aprons where water temperatures are below 35°C. Primary producers include chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea, as well as photautotrophic cyanobacteria, diatoms, filamentous algae and macrophytes. Herbivores are scarce, allowing development of thick algal mats, which are inhabited by invertebrate detritivores, notably Dipterans and Coleopterans, which may tolerate temperatures up to 55°C. Annelids and molluscs occupy less extreme microhabitats. Invertebrates exhibit some endemism due to habitat insularity. Specialised physiological traits enabling metabolic function and survival in extreme temperatures include thermophilic proteins with short amino acid lengths, chaperone molecules that assist protein folding, branched chain fatty acids and polyamines for membrane stabilisation, DNA repair systems and ‘upregulated’ glycolysis providing energy to regulate heat stress. Three mechanisms enable metabolic function in extremely acidic (pH<3) geothermal waters: proton efflux via active transport pumps that counter proton influx; decreased permeability of cell membranes to suppress proton entry into cytoplasm; and strong protein and DNA repair systems. Similar mechanisms enable metabolic function in waters with high concentrations of metal toxins.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Continual flows of geothermal groundwater sustain permanent surface water, which may be clear or highly turbid with suspended solids, as in ‘mud volcanoes’. Water temperatures vary from hot (>44°C) to extreme (>80°C) across local gradients (vent pools, geysers, mounds, sinter aprons, terraces, outflow streams) and span wet-dry tropical, hot-desert, mild-temperate, alpine and polar climates. Mineral salts are concentrated, but composition varies greatly among sites according to the properties of underlying igneous material. Hence, pH is either extremely acid (2-4) or neutral-alkaline (7-11). Dissolved and precipitated minerals may include very high concentrations of silica, arsenic, antimony, iron, polonium, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead or mercury, usually as oxides, sulfides or sulfates, but nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus may be scarce.

# Distribution

Volcanically active areas from tropical to subpolar latitudes, often associated with subduction zones. Notable examples in northwest USA (Yellowstone), Iceland, New Zealand and the Atacama desert, Chile.
