# Ecological traits


These coastal water bodies are mosaic systems characterized by high spatial and temporal variabilities in structure and function, which depend on coastal geomorphology, ratios of freshwater inflows to marine waters and tidal volume (hence residence time of saline water), and seasonality of climate. Fringing vegetation may include intertidal mangroves (MFT1.2), saltmarshes and reedbeds (MFT1.3), muddy (MT1.2) or sandy shores (MT13.), while seagrasses and macrophytes (M1.1) and shellfish beds (M1.4) may occur in shallow intertidal and subtidal areas. Water-column productivity is typically higher than in nearby marine or freshwater systems due to substantial allochthonous energy and nutrient subsidies from shoreline vegetation and riverine and marine sources. This high productivity supports a complex trophic network with relatively high mosaic-level diversity and abundance of aquatic organisms. Planktonic and benthic invertebrate (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans) assemblages often sustain large fish populations, with fish-nursery grounds being a common feature. Waterbirds (e.g. cormorants), seabirds (e.g. gannets), top-order predatory fish, mammals (e.g. dolphins, dugongs) and even reptiles (e.g. marine turtles, crocodilians) exploit these locally abundant food sources. Many of these organisms in upper trophic levels are highly mobile, and move among different estuaries through connected ocean waters or by flying. Others migrate between different ecosystem types to complete various life history phases, although some may remain resident for considerable periods. Most biota tolerate a broad range of salinity or are spatially structured by gradients. The complex spatial mixes of physical and chemical characteristics, alongside seasonal, interannual and sporadic variability in aquatic conditions, induce correspondingly large spatial-temporal variability in foodwebs. Freshwater plumes, usually proportional to river size and discharge may extend far from the shore, producing tongues of ecologically distinct conditions into the marine environment.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Characteristics of these coastal systems are governed by the relative dominance of saline marine waters versus freshwater inflows (groundwater, riverine), the latter depending on the seasonality of precipitation and evaporative stress. Geomorphology ranges from wave-dominated estuaries to drowned river valleys, to tiny inlets (10s of m2) to enormous bays. These forms determine the residence time, proportion and distribution of saline waters, which, in turn, affect salinity and thermal gradients and stratification, dissolved O2 concentration, nutrients, and turbidity. The water column is closely linked to mud- and sand-flats, in which an array of biogeochemical processes occurs, including denitrification and N-fixation, nutrient cycling, etc.


# Distribution


Coastlines of most landmasses, but rarely on arid or polar coasts.

**Map details**: Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors. Map was clipped to the terrestrial portion of the marine ecoregion due to their influence from coastal catchments.
