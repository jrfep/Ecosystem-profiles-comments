# Short description

These tropical swamps have closed forest canopies and experience high rainfall and consistent temperatures all year. In some, peat accumulates in anaerobic black water conditions, while others are highly productive white-water systems, with frequent refilling and turnover of nutrients. Trees and other plants, such as palms, pitcher plants, epiphytic mosses and ferns grow in soils that are waterlogged or periodically inundated.

# Key Features

Evergreen closed-canopy forests in tropical swamps and riparian zones, differing between high and low nutrients waters, and supporting complex trophic networks

# Distribution

Equatorial lowlands of Southeast Asia, South America and Central and West Africa
