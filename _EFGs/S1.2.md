# Ecological traits


Lithic matrices and their microscopic cracks and cavities, host microbial communities. Their very low productivity is constrained by scarcity of light, nutrients and water, and sometimes also by high temperatures. Diversity is low and the trophic network is truncated, supporting microscopic bacteria, archaea, viruses and unicellular eukaryotes. Most are detritivores or lithautotrophs, though some fissures are large enough to support small eukaryotic predators such as nematodes. Photoautotrophs (cyanobacteria) are present only in the surface layers of exposed rocks. Sampling suggests that these systems harbour 95% of the world’s prokaryote life (bacteria and archaea), with rocks below the deep oceans and continents containing similar densities of cells and potentially accounting for a significant proportion of sequestered carbon. Endolithic microbes are characterised by extremely slow reproductive rates, especially in deep sedimentary rocks, which are the most oligotrophic substrates. At some depth within both terrestrial and marine substrates, microbes are sustained by energy from organic matter that percolates through fissures from surface systems. In deeper or less permeable parts of the crust, however, lithautotrophic microbes are the primary energy synthesisers that sustain heterotrophs in the food web. They derive energy, oxidants, carbohydrates and simple organic acids from carbon dioxide, geological sources of hydrogen and mineral compounds of potassium, iron and sulphur. Methanogenic archaea and iron-reducing bacteria appear to be important autotrophs in sub-oceanic basalts. All endolithic microbes are characterised by slow metabolism and reproduction rates. At some locations they tolerate extreme pressures, temperatures (to 125°C) and acidity (pH<2), notably in crustal fluids. Little is currently known of endemism, but it may be expected to be high based on the insularity of these systems.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Endolithic systems are characterised by a lack of light, scarcity of nutrients and high pressures at depth. Temperatures vary within the crust from less than 20°C up to 125°C, but show little temporal variation. Chemical properties and physical structure of lithic matrices influence the supply of resources and movement of biota. Stable cratonic massifs have minimal pore space for microbial occupation, which is limited to occasional cracks and fissures. Sedimentary substrates offer more space, but nutrients may be scarce. Basic volcanics and crustal fluids have more abundant nutrients.  Chemical and biogenic weathering occurs through biogenic acids and other corrosive agents. The matrix is mostly stable, but disturbances include infrequent and spatially variable earthquakes and volcanic intrusions.

Throughout the earth's crust, from surface rocks to a predicted depth of up to 4-4.5 km below the land surface and 7-7.5 km below ocean floors.
