# Short description

Many plants and animals survive surface freezing of freshwater lakes, in dormant life stages, by reducing activity beneath the ice, or by moving. Such freshwater lakes vary enormously in size and distribution, providing a wide range of habitats for many organisms, which undergo a succession of emergence during lake thaw. The annual thaw triggers highly productive plant and animal activity, beginning with diatom algae and then zooplankton. Habitat diversity increases with lake size, increasing the variety of plankton, aquatic plants, waterbugs, birds, and sometimes fish.

# Key Features

Waterbodies with frozen surfaces for at least one month of the year, with spring thaw initiating trophic successional dynamics beginning with a flush of diatom productivity. Deeper lakes may be cold stratified and fish tolerate oxygen depletion in winter

# Distribution

Boreal regions, cool temperate continental Eurasia and North America and high altitudes of South America regions
