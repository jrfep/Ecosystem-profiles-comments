# Ecosystem properties

Structurally simple evergreen forests with high densities of thin stems, closed to open uniform canopies, typically 5â€“20 m tall and uniform with a moderate to high LAI. Productivity is lower than in other tropical forests, weakly seasonal and limited by nutrient availability and in some cases by soil anoxia, but decomposition is rapid. Plant traits such as insectivory, N-fixing microbial associations and ant mutualisms are well represented, suggesting adaptive responses to nitrogen deficiency. Plant insectivory aside, trophic networks are simple compared to other tropical forests. Diversity of plant and animal taxa is also relatively low, but dominance and endemism are proportionately high. Tree foliage is characterised by small (microphyll-notophyll) leaves with lower SLA than other tropical forests. Leaves are leathery and often ascending vertically, enabling more light penetration to ground level than in other tropical forests. Tree stems are slender (generally <20 cm in diameter), sometimes twisted, and often densely packed and without buttresses. Epiphytes are usually abundant but lianas are rare and ground vegetation is sparse, with the forest floor dominated by insectivorous vascular plants and bryophytes.

# Ecological Drivers

These forests experience an overall water surplus, but productivity is limited by deep sandy low-nutrient acidic substrates, which are leached by high rainfall. Acidity promotes high Al levels that inhibit root growth. Most nutrients are retained in vegetation. Downward movement of clay and organic particles through the soil profile results in a deep, white sandy horizon capped by a thin grey surface horizon (typical of podzols), limiting the capacity of the soil to retain nutrients (especially nitrogen) and moisture within the shallow rooting zone. Hence they are prone to inter-annual droughts, but waterlogging may occur where the water table is close to the surface, resulting in periodic anoxia within the root zone. Landscape water-table gradients result in surface mosaics in which heath forests may be juxtaposed with more waterlogged peat forests (TF1.1) and palustrine wetland systems (TF1.2).

# Distribution

Scattered through northwest and west Amazonia, possibly Guiana, and Southeast Asia, notably in the Rio Negro catchment and southern Kalimantan. Poorly known in Africa, but possibly in the Gabon region.
