# Ecological traits

Structurally simple evergreen forests with closed to open canopies, typically 5-20 m tall and uniform with a moderate to high LAI. Productivity is lower than in other tropical forests, weakly seasonal and limited by nutrient availability and in some cases by soil anoxia, but decomposition rates are high. Plant traits such as insectivory and N-fixing microbial associations are well-represented, suggesting adaptive responses to nitrogen deficiency. Aside from plant insectivory, trophic networks are simple compared to other tropical forests. Diversity of plant and animal taxa is also relatively low, but endemism is proportionately high. Tree foliage is characteristically small (microphyll) leaves with lower SLA than other tropical forests. Tree stems are slender (generally <20 cm diameter), twisted, often densely packed and without buttresses. Epiphytes are usually abundant but lianes are rare and ground vegetation is sparse, with the forest floor dominated by insectivorous vascular plants and bryophytes.

# Key-ecological-drivers

These forests experience an overall water surplus, but productivity is limited by deep sandy low-nutrient acidic substrates, which are strongly leached by high rainfall. Most nutrients are retained in vegetation. Downward movement of clay and organic particles through the soil profile results in a deep, white sandy horizon capped by a thin grey surface horizon (typical of podsols), limiting the capacity of the soil to retain nutrients and moisture within the rooting zone. Hence they are prone to interannual droughts, but waterlogging may occur where the water table is close to the surface, resulting in periodic anoxia within the root zone.  Landscape water table gradients result in surface mosaics in which heath forests may be juxtaposed with peat forests (FT1.1) and palustrine wetland systems (FT1.2).

# Distribution

Scattered through northwest and west Amazonia and southeast Asia, most notably in the Rio Negro catchment and southern Kalimantan. Not known from Africa, but possibly in the Congo region.

{% capture map_det %} Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews (cited in respective reference sections of profiles), maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts. {% endcapture %}
