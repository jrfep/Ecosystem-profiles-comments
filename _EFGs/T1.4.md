# Ecological Traits
 
Structurally simple evergreen forests with closed to open canopies, typically 5–20 m tall and uniform with a moderate to high LAI. Productivity is lower than in other tropical forests, weakly seasonal and limited by nutrient availability and in some cases by soil anoxia, but decomposition rates are high. Plant traits such as insectivory and N-fixing microbial associations are well represented, suggesting adaptive responses to nitrogen deficiency. Aside from plant insectivory, trophic networks are simple compared to other tropical forests. Diversity of plant and animal taxa is also relatively low, but endemism is proportionately high. Tree foliage is characterised by small (microphyll-notophyll) leaves with lower SLA than other tropical forests. Leaves are leathery and often ascending vertically, enabling more light penetration to ground level than in other tropical forests. Tree stems are slender (generally <20 cm in diameter), sometimes twisted, and often densely packed and without buttresses. Epiphytes are usually abundant but lianas are rare and ground vegetation is sparse, with the forest floor dominated by insectivorous vascular plants and bryophytes.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These forests experience an overall water surplus, but productivity is limited by deep sandy low-nutrient acidic substrates, which are leached by high rainfall. Most nutrients are retained in the vegetation. Downward movement of clay and organic particles through the soil profile results in a deep, white sandy horizon capped by a thin grey surface horizon (typical of podzols), limiting the capacity of the soil to retain nutrients (especially nitrogen) and moisture within the shallow rooting zone. Hence they are prone to inter-annual droughts, but waterlogging may occur where the water table is close to the surface, resulting in periodic anoxia within the root zone. Landscape water-table gradients result in surface mosaics in which heath forests may be juxtaposed with more waterlogged peat forests (TF1.1) and palustrine wetland systems (TF1.2).

# Distribution
 
Scattered through northwest and west Amazonia, possibly Guiana, and Southeast Asia, notably in the Rio Negro catchment and southern Kalimantan. Not known in Africa, but possibly in the Congo region.

Terrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution.
