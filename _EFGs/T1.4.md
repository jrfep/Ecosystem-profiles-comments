These structurally unique forests are restricted to less fertile soils on acidic sandy substrates best known in Amazonia and Southeast Asia. They are characterised by high densities of low, slender trees that allow light penetration to an open forest floor covered with mosses. They have low productivity compared to other tropical forests, with a limited diversity of plants and animals forming a simple foodweb, including amphibians and reptiles.

### Key Features

Low closed-canopy evergreen forests in warm wet climates on low-nutrient substrates, structurally simple cf T1.

### Distribution

Amazon basin, southeast Asia, possibly Congo basin.
