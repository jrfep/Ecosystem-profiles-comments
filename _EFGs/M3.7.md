# Ecological Traits
 
CBEs include 3 major types of habitats between bathyal and abyssal depths: 1) hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges, back arc basins and active seamounts; 2) cold seeps on active and passive continental margins; and 3) large organic falls such as whale- or wood-falls. All these systems are characterised by microbial primary productivity through chemoautotrophy, which uses reduced compounds (such as H2S, CH4) as energy sources instead of light. Microbes form bacterial mats and occur in trophic symbiosis with most megafauna. The continuous source of energy and microbial symbiosis fuel high faunal biomass. However, specific environmental factors (high temperature gradients at vents, chemical toxicity, symbiosis dependence) result in low diversity and high endemism of highly specialised fauna.  Habitat structure comprises hard substrate on vent chimneys, and mostly biogenic substrate at seeps and food-falls. Most fauna is sessile or with low motility, and depends on the fluids emanating at vents and seeps, or chemicals produced by microbes on food-falls, and thus is spatially limited. Large tubeworms, shrimp, crabs, bivalves and gastropods dominate many hydrothermal vents, with marked biogeographic provinces. Tubeworms, mussels and decapod crustaceans often dominate cold seeps with demersal fish. These are patchy ecosystems where connectivity relies on dispersal of planktonic larvae. 
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
No light penetrates to deep-sea CBEs. Hydrostatic pressure is very high (30-600 atm). At hydrothermal vents, very hot fluids (up to 400 °C) emanate from chimneys charged with metals and reduced chemicals that provide energy to chemoautotrophic microbes. At cold seeps, the fluids are cold, and reduced chemicals originate both biogenically and abiotically. At food-falls, the reduced chemicals are produced by microorganisms degrading the organic matter of the fall. The main driver of CBEs is the chemosynthetically-based primary productivity and symbiotic relationships between microorganisms and fauna.

# Distribution
 
Seafloor of all oceans. Vents (map) occur on mid-ocean ridges, back arc basins and active seamounts. Cold seeps occur on active and passive continental margins. Food-falls occur mostly along cetacean migration routes (whale falls).

The indicative map of Chemosynthetic-based ecosystems was based on the distribution of hydrothermal vents on spreading plate boundaries  mapped in ‘Plate lines and polygons’ data by USGS/ESRI. Distribution of cold seeps is poorly known and not mapped.
