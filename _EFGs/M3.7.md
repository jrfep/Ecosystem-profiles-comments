In these very deep, high pressure ecosystems, primary productivity is fuelled by chemical compounds as energy sources instead of light (chemoautotrophy). This group of productive deep sea ecosystems include: 1) hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges and volcanically active seamounts, where temperatures may reach 400Â°C; 2) cold seeps typically on continental slopes; and 3) large organic falls of whales or wood. These specialised environments have high biomass but low diversity of organisms including microbes, tubeworms and shrimps, many of which are locally unique.

### Key Features

Systems supported by microbial chemoautotrophy with high biomass of relatively low diversity, highly speciliased, fauna.

### Overview of distribution

Hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, large organic falls on the deep seafloor.
