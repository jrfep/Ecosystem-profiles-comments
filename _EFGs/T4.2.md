# Ecosystem properties

Grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 tussock grasses, with some C3 grasses in the Americas and variable tree cover. In the tropics, seasonally high productivity coincides with the timing of summer rains and grasses cure in dry winters, promoting flammability. This pattern also occurs in the subtropics but transitions occur with temperate woodlands (T4.4), which have different seasonal phenology, tree and grass dominance, and fire regimes. Tree basal area, abundance of plants with annual semelparous life cycles and abundant grasses with tall tussock growth forms are strongly dependent on mean annual rainfall (i.e. limited by seasonal drought). Local endemism is low across all taxa but regional endemism is high, especially in the Americas and Australasia. Plant traits such as deciduous leaf phenology or deep roots promote tolerance to seasonal drought and rapid resource exploitation. Woody plants have microphyll-notophyll foliage with moderate-high SLA and mostly high C:N ratios. Some C4 grasses nonetheless accumulate high levels of rubisco, which may push down C:N ratios. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition because fire is the major consumer of biomass. Woody plant species are shade-intolerant during their establishment and develop fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark and below-ground bud banks). The contiguous ground layer of erect tussock grasses creates an aerated flammable fuel bed, while grass architecture with tightly clustered culms vent heat away from meristems. Patchy fires promote landscape-scale vegetation heterogeneity (e.g. in tree cover) and maintain the dominance of flammable tussock grasses over shrubs, especially in wetter climates, and hence sustain the system through positive feedbacks. Fires also enhance efficiency of predators. Vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Mammalian herbivores and predators are present but exert less top-down influence on the diverse trophic structure than fire. Consequently, plant physical defences against herbivores, such as spinescence are less prominent than in T4.1.

# Ecological Drivers

An overall rainfall deficit up to ~1,200 mm or a modest surplus of up to 500 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought with continuously warm-hot temperatures through the year, even though rainfall becomes less seasonal in the subtropics. Mean annual rainfall varies from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. Sub-decadal fire regimes of surface fires occur throughout the dry season, while canopy fires occur rarely, late in the dry season. Soils are of low-moderate fertility, often with high Fe and Al.
