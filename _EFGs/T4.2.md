# Short description

In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence. Dominated by tussock grasses that grow tall during high-productivity wet summers and cure over dry winter seasons, these ecosystems occur on all major land masses at tropical and subtropical latitudes around the world. Large mammalian herbivores are usually present, but not at densities that limit grass growth or mediate tree-grass coexistence (unlike T4.1). Many plants have traits that promote  tolerate of seasonal drought, such as deciduous leaf phenology, subterranean storage organs and deep roots. Invertebrate detritivores, notably termites,  and vertebrate scavengers are key groups in the foodweb.

# Key Features

Grasslands and grassy woodlands dominated by C4 tussock grasses. Strong seasonal (winter) drought, low fertility, and fires major consumer of biomass.

# Distribution

Global wet/dry tropics & subtropics
