# Ecological traits

In these icy systems, extreme cold and periodic blizzards limit productivity and diversity to very low levels, and trophic networks are truncated. Surface life is dominated by micro-organisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and algae that become active during the short summer. On the surface, their metabolic activity is generally restricted to summer months at temperatures close to zero, and is enabled by expolymeric substances, cold-adapted enzymes, cold-shock proteins and other physiological traits. N-fixing cyanobacteria are critical in the N-cycle, especially in late summer. Surface heterogeneity and dynamism related to cryoconite holes are critical to microbial diversity. Most vertebrates are migratory birds with only the emperor penguin over-wintering on Antarctic ice. Pinnipeds and polar bears utilise sea ice for breeding and feeding. Mass movement and snow burial also places severe constraints on establishment and persistence of life. Below the ice, the only forms of life, are heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic prokaryotes and fungi.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Permanent but dynamic ice cover accumulates by periodic snow fall and is reduced in summer by melting, sublimation and calving in the ablation zone. Slow lateral movement occurs downslope or outwards from ice cap centres, with associated cracking. Precipitation may average several metres per year on montane glaciers or less than a few hundred millimetres on extensive ice sheets. Surface temperatures are extremely cold in winter (commonly -60°C in Antarctica) but may rise above 0°C in summer. Desiccating conditions occur during high winds or when water is present almost entirely in solid form. Nutrients, especially N, are extremely scarce, the main inputs being glacial moraines, aerosols, and seawater (in sea ice), which may be supplemented locally by guano. Below the ice, temperatures are less extreme, there is greater contact between ice, water and rock (enhancing nutrient supply), a diminished light intensity and redox potential tends towards anoxic conditions.

# Distribution

Polar regions and high mountains in the western Americas, central Asia, Europe and New Zealand, covering approximately 10% of Earth's surface.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
