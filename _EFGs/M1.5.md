# Short description

These subtidal biogenic ecosystems, formed by either a single species or a community of sessile filter feeders such as sponges, ascidians or aphotic corals, are found mostly on hard substrates.  Low light due to depth, turbidity, ice cover or tannins from terrestrial runoff means that photosynthesis is limited to microphytobenthos (like microalgae and bacteria) or coralline algae. As a result, nutrient flux from surface waters is important. A high diversity of invertebrates and fish are also associated with these complex, three-dimensional forest-like habitats.

# Key Features

Largely heterotrophic systems dominated by megabenthic suspension feeders and associated diverse epifauna, microphytobenthos and fish

# Distribution

Low light tropical to polar coastal waters
