# Ecological traits


These benthic systems are characterised by high densities of megabenthic sessile heterotrophic suspension feeders that act as habitat engineers and dominate a subordinate autotrophic biota. The major sessile animals include sponges, aphotic corals, hydroids, hydrocorals, bryozoans, polychaetes and bivalves (though the latter are rarely dominant, cf. M1.4). These engineer complex three-dimensional biogenic structures, sometimes of a single species or distinct phylogenetic group. The structural complexity generates heterogeneity in environmental conditions and habitat, and promotes a high diversity of invertebrate epifauna, with microphytobenthos and fishes. In some instances endemism may be high. Primary productivity is limited by low light, which largely excludes macroalgae, although microphytobenthos can be important. This distinguishes these systems from their deepwater aphotic counterparts (M3.7). Overall, however, these systems are strongly heterotrophic,  relying on benthic-pelagic coupling. Consequently, they are often found near shallower, less photo-limited high productivity areas. Complex biogeochemical cycles govern nutrient release, particle retention, and carbon fixation. Biodiversity is enhanced by secondary consumers: deposit-feeding and filter-feeding invertebrates. Predators may influence the biomass and diversity of epifaunal prey organisms. Recruitment processes in benthic animals can be episodic and highly localised and, together with slow growth rates, , limit the pace of recovery from disturbance.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Light is generally insufficient to support macroalgae but above the photosynthetic threshold for coralline algae and cyanobacteria. Light is limited by diffusion through deep water, surface ice cover, turbidity from river outflow or tannins in terrestrial runoff. Low to moderate temperatures may further limit productivity.  These systems are generally found on hard substrates, but can occur on soft substrates. Currents or resuspension and lateral transport processes are important drivers of benthic-pelagic coupling, and hence food and nutrient supply. Natural physical disturbances are generally of low severity and frequency levels, but ice scour can generate successional mosaics on subpolar shelves.

# Distribution

Tropical to polar coastal waters, extending from the shallow subtidal to “twilight” zone on the shelf. Present-day distributions are likely to have been modified by benthic trawling.

## Map details

These are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in yellow through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
