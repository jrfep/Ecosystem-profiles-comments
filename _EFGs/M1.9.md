# Ecological Traits
 
Upwelling zones are very productive ecosystems. Upwelled, nutrient-rich water supports net autochthonous primary production in the form of diatom blooms. These in turn support high biomasses of copepods, euphausiids, pelagic and demersal fish, marine mammals and birds. Fish biomass tends to be dominated by low to mid trophic level species such as sardine, anchovy and herring. The abundance of these small pelagic fish tends to drive system dynamics in what has been termed ‘wasp-waisted’ trophic control, exerting top-down control on the copepod and euphausiid plankton groups they feed on, and bottom-up control as prey for predatory fish species. Characteristically abundant species of higher trophic levels include hake and horse mackerel, as well as pinnipeds and seabirds. Reproductive success of planktivorous fish is highly variable as it is influenced by suitable conditions for concentrating and retaining e.g. and larvae inshore prior to maturity.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Upwelling is a wind-driven process that draws cold, nutrient-rich water towards the surface displacingwarmer, nutrient-depleted waters. The strength of upwelling depends on interactions between local current systems and Coriolis that cause divergence, generally on the eastern boundaries of oceans rather than the west . The rate of upwelling and offshore transportation of nutrients and the degree of stratification in the water column once upwelling has occurred, determines the availability of nutrients to plankton, and hence the size and structure of the community that develops after an event. The main upwelling systems around the world, extend to depths of up to 500 m at the shelf-break, although primary production is restricted to the epipelagic zone (< 200 m). Upwelling zones are characterised by low sea surface temperatures and high chlorophyll-a concentrations, high variability due to the pulsed and seasonal nature of the driving winds, and occasional low-oxygen events due to high biological activity and die-offs.

# Distribution
 
The most productive upwelling zones are coastal, notably in four major eastern boundary current systems (Canary, Benguela, California, and Humboldt), although upwelling does also occur in the open ocean (e.g. along the Intertropical Convergence Zone).

Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) with major and minor occurrences of Upwelling zones were identified by consulting global and regional reviews (cited in respective reference sections of profiles), maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors. The identified ecoregions were then clipped to the extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
