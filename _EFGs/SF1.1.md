# Ecological traits


Subterranean streams, pools and aquatic voids are low-productivity systems devoid of light. Taxonomic and functional diversity of these water bodies is low, but they may host many local endemics, depending on connectivity with surface waters and between cave systems. The trophic network is truncated and dominated by heterotrophs, with no representation of photosynthetic primary producers or herbivores. Detritivores and their predators are dominant, although a few specialist predators may be associated with resource-rich hotspots. Microbial mats composed of bacteria and aquatic fungi covering submerged rock surfaces are major food sources for protozoans and invertebrates. Other biota include planktonic bacteria, crustacea, annelids, molluscs, arachnids. Transient vertebrates, notably fish, occur only in subterranean waters that are well connected to surface streams with abundant food. Chemautotrophic proteobacteria are locally abundant in sulphur-rich waters fed by springs, but not widespread. Obligate denizens of subterranean waters complete their life cycles entirely below ground and derive from relatively few evolutionary lineages. These make up a variable portion of the biota, depending on connectivity to surface waters. Most are generalist detritivores coexisting under weak competitive interactions. Some are also opportunistic predators, reflecting selection pressures of food scarcity. Distinctive traits include absence of eyes and pigmentation, long life spans, slow metabolism and growth rates, and low fecundity. Other biota include less specialised taxa that live above or below ground, at least  for parts of their life cycles, as well as temporary below-ground inhabitants.


# Key-ecological-drivers


A large majority of caves form from chemical weathering of limestone, others include lava tunnels. Cave waters are characterised by the absence of light, low oxygen and nutrient availability, scarcity of food and low variability in temperature. Resource supply and biotic dispersal depend critically on connectivity with surface waters, flow velocity and turbulence. In the absence of light, surface-connected streams are major allochthonous sources of energy and nutrients. Disconnected epigenic or hypogenic systems are the most biologically insular and oligotrophic, and may also be limited by nutrient imbalance. These features promote insular evolution in stable conditions.


# Distribution


Scattered worldwide, mostly in the northern hemisphere in limestones (map), more rarely basalt flows and other lithic substrates.


## Map details

Distributions of Underground streams and pools were based on mapped area of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016). This. provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain, as not all carbonate rocks are karstified. Lava tubes and other rocks that may contain these ecosystem functional groups are not shown on this indicative map, but are less extensive than those in carbonate rock.
