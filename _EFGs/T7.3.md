# Ecological traits

These moderate to high productivity autotrophic systems are established by translocation (planting or seeding) of woody perennial plants. Target biota may be genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues and tolerance of harsh environmental conditions, insect predators and diseases. The diversity, structure, composition, function and successional trajectory of the system depends on the identity, developmental stage, density and traits (e.g. phenology, physiognomy, growth rate, etc.) of planted species, as well as subsequent management of plantation development. Most plantations comprise at least two vertical strata; the managed woody species and a ruderal ground layer, but mixed forest plantings may be more complex and host a relatively diverse flora and fauna if managed to promote habitat features. Mixed cropping systems may comprise two vertical strata of woody crops or a woody and herbaceous layer. Secondary successional processes involve colonisation and regeneration, initially of opportunistic biota. Successional feedbacks occur as structural complexity increases, promoting visits or colonisation by vertebrates and associated dispersal of plants and other organisms. Crop replacement, which may occur on interannual or decadal cycles, intensive management of plantation structure or control of non-target species may reset, arrest or redirect successional processes. Examples with increasing management intervention include: environmental plantations established for wildlife or ecosystem services; agroforestry plantings for subsistence products or livestock benefits; forestry plantations for timber, pulp, fibre, bio-energy, rubber or oils; vineyards, orchards and other perennial food crops (e.g. cassava, coffee, tea, palm oil, nuts). Secondary (regrowth) forests and shrublands are not included as plantations, even where management includes supplementary translocations.

# Key-ecological-drivers

High to moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is supplemented by human inputs of fertiliser or mulch, landscape drainage modifications (surface earthworks) and in intensively managed systems, irrigation. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Artificial disturbance regimes involving complete or partial removal of biomass, and soil turnover are implemented at subdecadal to multidecadal frequencies.

# Distribution

Tropical to cool temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and Mediterranean Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australasia, Oceania and the Americas.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
