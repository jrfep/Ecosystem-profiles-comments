# Ecological traits

These low-productivity systems in subterranean, epigenic air-filled voids are created anthropogenically by excavation. Although similar to Aerobic caves (S1.1), these systems are structurally simpler, younger, more geologically varied, and much less biologically diverse with few evolutionary lineages and no local endemism. Low diversity and endemism, and opportunistic biotic traits, stem from founder effects related to the recent anthropogenic origin (hence few colonisation events and little time for evolutionary divergence), as well as low microhabitat niche diversity due to the simple structure of void walls cf. natural caves. The trophic network is truncated and dominated by heterotrophs, usually with no representation of photosynthetic primary producers or herbivores. Generalist detritivores and their pathogens and predators dominate, although some specialists may be associated with bat dung deposits. Biota include invertebrates (notably beetles, springtails and arachnids), fungi, bacteria and transient vertebrates, notably bats, which use the voids as roosts and breeding sites. Bacteria and fungi form biofilm on void surfaces. Many are colonists of human inoculations, with some microbes  identified as “human indicator bacteria” (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and high-temperature Bacillus spp.). Fungi are most abundant in humid microsites. Some are parasites and many are critical food sources for invertebrates and protozoans. Sources of energy and nutrients are allochthonous, imported by humans, bats, winged invertebrates, other animals and seepage moisture. Many taxa have long life spans, slow metabolism and growth, and low fecundity, but lack distinctive traits found in biota of natural caves. Some are are temporary below-ground inhabitants, have populations that live entirely above- or below-ground or life cycles necessitating use of both environments.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Excavations associated with tunnels, vaults and mines. While some are abandoned, others are continually accessed by humans, enhancing connectivity with the surface, resource importation and biotic dispersal. Substrates include a range of rock types, as well as artificial surfaces on linings and debris piles. Air movement varies from still to turbulent (e.g. active train tunnels). Light is absent, except at openings and where artificial sources are maintained by humans, sometimes supporting algae (lamenflora).  Humidity  and temperature are relatively constant, and nutrients are scarce except where enriched by human sources.

# Distribution

Scattered worldwide, but mostly associated with urban centres, transit corridors and industrial mines.
