Industrial excavations create artificial voids that resemble caves. Like caves, they lack inputs of solar energy, and plants and herbivores are absent, except at their openings or around artificial lighting. They are colonised by opportunistic invertebrates and vertebrates, and microbes from the rock matrix or imported materials. Diversity is low, but depends on proximity to openings, human activity during occupation and time since excavation.

### Key Features

Dry or humid subterranean voids created by mining or infrastructure development and colonised by opportunistic microbes, invertebrates and sometimes vertebrates..

### Overview of distribution

Associated with urban and industrial infrastructure worldwide.
