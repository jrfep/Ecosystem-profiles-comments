# Ecological traits

These coastal water bodies have high spatial and temporal variability in structure and function, which depends largely on the status of the lagoonal entrance as open or closed.  Communities generally have low species richness when compared to those of permanently open estuaries (FM1.2) because lagoonal entrance closure prevents entry of marine organisms and resident biota must tolerate significant variation in salinity, inundation, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations. Resident communities are dominated by opportunists, with relatively short life cycles. Trophic networks are generally detritus-based, fuelled by substantial inputs of organic matter from the terrestrial environment and, to a lesser extent, from the sea. As net sinks of organic matter from the land, productivity is often high, and lagoons may serve as nursery habitats for fish. High tannin concentrations in the water and periods of low nutrient input limit phytoplankton populations. Benthic communities dominate with attached algae, microphytobenthos and micro- and macro-fauna being the dominant groups. The water column supports plankton and small-bodied fish. Saltmarsh (MFT1.3) can adjoin lagoons, but mangroves (MFT1.2) are absent unless the entrance opens frequently.

# Key-ecological-drivers

These are shallow coastal water bodies that are intermittently connected with the ocean. Some lagoons are mostly open, closing only once every few decades, some open and close frequently, and some are closed most of the time. The timing and frequency of entrance opening depends on trade-offs between sedimentation from fluvial and shoreline processes, which act to close the connection, and flushes of catchment inflow or erosive wave action, which act to open the entrance. Opening leads to changes in water level, tidal amplitude, salinity gradients, temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen and sources of organic carbon.

# Distribution

Wave-dominated coastlines worldwide, but prevalent along microtidal to low mesotidal mid-latitude coastlines with high interannual variability in rainfall and wave climate. Intermittent Closed Open Lakes  & Lagoons (ICOLLs) are most prevalent in Australia (21% global ICOLLs), South Africa (16%) and Mexico (16%).

## Map details

Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors. Map was clipped to the terrestrial portion of the marine ecoregion due to their influence from coastal catchments.
