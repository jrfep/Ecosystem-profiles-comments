# Ecosystem properties

These coastal water bodies have high spatial and temporal variability in structure and function, which depends largely on the status of the lagoonal entrance (open or closed). Communities have low species richness compared to those of permanently open estuaries (FM1.2). Lagoonal entrance closure prevents the entry of marine organisms and resident biota must tolerate significant variation in salinity, inundation, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations. Resident communities are dominated by opportunists with short lifecycles. Trophic networks are generally detritus-based, fuelled by substantial inputs of organic matter from the terrestrial environment and, to a lesser extent, from the sea. As net sinks of organic matter from the land, productivity is often high, and lagoons may serve as nursery habitats for fish. High concentrations of polyphenolic compounds (e.g. tannins) in the water and periods of low nutrient input limit phytoplankton populations. Benthic communities dominate with attached algae, microphytobenthos and micro- and macro-fauna being the dominant groups. The water column supports plankton and small-bodied fish. Emergent and fringing vegetation is a key source of detrital carbon to the food webs, and also provides important structural habitats. Saltmarsh and reedbeds (MFT1.3) can adjoin lagoons while seagrasses (M1.1) occupy sandy bottoms of some lagoons, but mangroves (MFT1.2) are absent unless the entrance opens

# Ecological Drivers

These are shallow coastal water bodies that are intermittently connected with the ocean. Some lagoons are mostly open, closing only once every few decades. Some open and close frequently and some are closed most of the time. The timing and frequency of entrance opening depend on trade-offs between sedimentation from fluvial and shoreline processes (which close the connection) and flushes of catchment inflow or erosive wave action (which open the entrance). Opening leads to changes in water level, tidal amplitude, salinity gradients, temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and sources of organic carbon. Human-regulated opening influences many of these processes.

# Distribution

Wave-dominated coastlines worldwide, but prevalent along microtidal to low mesotidal mid-latitude coastlines with high inter-annual variability in rainfall and wave climate. Intermittent closed open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) are most prevalent in Australia (21% of global occurrences), South Africa (16%), and Mexico (16%).
