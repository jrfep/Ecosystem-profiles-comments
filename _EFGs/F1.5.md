# Ecosystem properties

These large riverine systems (stream orders 5-9) can be highly productive with trophic structures and processes shaped by seasonal hydrology and linkages to floodplain wetlands. In combination with biophysical heterogeneity, this temporal variability promotes functional diversity in the biota. Although trophic networks are complex due to the diversity of food sources and the extent of omnivory amongst consumers, food chains tend to be short and large mobile predators such as otters, large piscivorous waterbirds, sharks, dolphins, and crocodilians (in the tropics) can have a major impact on the food webs. Benthic algae are key contributors to primary productivity, although macrophytes become more important during the peak and late wet season when they also provide substrate for epiphytic algae. Rivers receive very significant resource subsidies from both algae and macrophytes on adjacent floodplains when they are connected by flows. Enhanced longitudinal hydrological connectivity during the wet season enables fish and other large aquatic consumers to function as mobile links, extending floodplain and estuarine resource subsidies upstream. Life cycle processess including reproduction, recruitment, and dispersal in most biota are tightly cued to seasonally high flow periods, often with floodplain nursery areas for river fish, amphibians and larger invertebrates.

# Ecological Drivers

These rivers are driven by cyclical, seasonal flow regimes. High-volume flows and floods occur during summer in the tropics or winter-spring at temperate latitudes, with two peaks in some areas. A decline of flows and reduced flood residence times during the transition to the dry season is followed by low and disconnected flows during the dry season. Turbidity, light availability, erosion, sedimentation, lateral and longitudinal connectivity, biological activity, dissolved oxygen and solute concentrations all vary with this seasonal cycle. The inter-annual variability of this pattern depends on the catchment precipitation and sources of inflow that offset or mute the influences of rainfall seasonality (e.g. snow melt in South Asia). Streams may be single, multi-channelled or complex anabranching systems.
