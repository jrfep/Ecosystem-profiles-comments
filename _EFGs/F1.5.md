# Ecological Traits
 
These riverine systems can be highly productive with trophic structures and processes shaped by the strongly seasonal dynamics of flooding. In combination with biophysical heterogeneity, this temporal variability promotes functional diversity in the biota. Although trophic networks are complex due to the diversity of consumers, large mobile predators such as otters, waterbirds, sharks, dolphins and crocodilians are omnivorous, hence food chains are short. Aquatic algae are key contributors to primary productivity, although macrophytes become more important during peak and late wet season when they also provide substrates for epiphytic algae. Rivers receive significant resource subsidies from both algae and macrophytes on adjacent floodplains during the wet season. In addition, enhanced longitudinal hydrological connectivity during the wet season enables fish and crocodilian consumers to function as mobile links, extending floodplain and estuarine resource subsidies upstream. Life cycles are tightly cued to wet season flows, with reproduction, recruitment and dispersal in most of the biota occurring at this time.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These rivers are driven by cyclical seasonal flow regimes. High-volume  flows and floods occur during the summer monsoon season, coinciding with warm temperatures. These are followed by drawdown of flows and flood residence times during the transition to the dry season,  low and disconnected flows during the dry season, and the initial flushing flows during transition to the wet season. Turbidity, light availability, erosion, sedimentation, lateral and longitudinal connectivity, biological activity and dissolved oxygen all vary with this seasonal cycle.  The strength and interannual variablity of this pattern varies  depending on the seasonality of catchment ranfall and the influences of non-monsoonal sources of water such as snow melt (e.g. south Asia). Streams may be single and multi-channelled or complex anabranching systems. There may be two flood peaks during the year in catchments located close to the equatorial zone.

Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of rivers and streams were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
