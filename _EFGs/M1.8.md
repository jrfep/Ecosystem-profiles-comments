# Ecological traits

Muddy substrates of continental and island shelves support moderately productive ecosystems based on net allochthonous energy sources. In situ primary production is limited mainly to benthic diatoms, as macrophytes are scarce or absent, and both decline with depth as light diminishes. Deposit feeders, notably burrowing polychaetes, crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs, dominate the trophic network, as the low kinetic energy environment promotes vertical food fluxes, which they are able to exploit more effectively than suspension feeders. The latter are less abundant on Subtidal mud plains than rocky reefs (M1.6) and Subtidal sand beds (M1.7) where waters are more turbulent and generate stronger lateral food fluxes.  Deposit feeders may also constrain the abundance of co-occurring suspension feeders by disturbing benthic sediment that resettles and smothers their larvae and clogs their filtering structures. Although such interference mechanisms may be important, competition is generally weak. In contrast, foraging predators, including demersal fish, may have a major structuring influence on these systems through impacts on the abundance of infauna, particularly on settling larvae and recently settled juveniles, but also adults. Burrowing is a key mechanism of predator avoidance, and the associated bioturbation is influential on microhabitat diversity and resource availability within the sediment.

# Key-ecological-drivers

These depositional systems are characterised by low kinetic energy (weak turbulence and currents), which promotes accumulation of fine-textured, stable sediments that are best developed on flat bottoms or gentle slopes. The benthic surface is relatively homogeneous, except where structure is engineered by burrowing organisms.  The small particle size and poor interchange of interstitial water limit oxygen supply, and anaerobic conditions are especially promoted where abundant infall of organic matter supports higher bacterial activity that depletes available dissolved oxygen. On the other hand, the stability of muddy substrates makes them more conducive to the establishment of permanent burrows.  Bioturbation and bio-irrigation activities by a variety of benthic fauna in muddy substrates are important contributors to marine nutrient and biogeochemical cycling, as well as replenishment of oxygen.

# Distribution

Globally distributed in low energy waters of continental and island shelves.

## Map details

These are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in yellow through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
