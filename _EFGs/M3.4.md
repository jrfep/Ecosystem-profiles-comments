# Ecological traits

Seamounts, plateaus and ridges are major geomorphic features of the deep oceanic seafloor, characterized by hard substrates, elevated topography and often higher productivity than surrounding waters. Topographically modified currents affect geochemical cycles, nutrient mixing processes and detrital fallout from the euphotic zone that deliver allochthonous energy and nutrients to these heterotroph-dominated systems. Suspension-feeders and their dependents and predators dominate the trophic web, whereas deposit feeders and mixed feeders are less abundant than in other deep-sea systems, and autotrophs are generally absent. Summits that reach the euphotic zone are included within functional groups of the Marine shelf biome. Bathymetric gradients and local substrate heterogeneity support marked variation in diversity, composition and abundance. Rocky walls, for example, may be dominated by sessile suspension-feeders including cnidarians (especially corals), sponges, crinoids and ascidians. High densities of sessile animals may form deep-water biogenic beds (M3.5), but those systems are not limited to seamounts or ridges. Amongst the mobile benthic fauna, molluscs and echinoderms can be abundant. Seamounts also support dense aggregations of large fish, attracted by the high secondary productivity of lower trophic levels in the system, as well as spawning and/or nursery habitats. Elevated topography profoundly affects the distribution of both benthic and pelagic fauna. Seamounts and ridges tend to act both as stepping stones for dispersal of mountain biota and as dispersal barriers between adjacent basins, while insular seamounts may have high endemism.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Seamounts, rising more than 1000 m above the sediment-covered seabed, and smaller peaks, knobs and hills are topographically-isolated features, mostly of volcanic origin. Mid-ocean ridges are semi-continuous mountain chains that mark the spreading margins of adjacent tectonic plates. These prominent topographic formations interact with water masses and currents, increasing turbulence, mixing, particle retention, and upward movement of nutrients from large areas of the seafloor. This enhances productivity on the seamounts and ridges themselves, and also in the euphotic zone above, some of which returns to the system through detrital fallout. A diversity of topographic, bathymetric and hydrodynamic features and substrate types (i.e. steep rocky walls, flat muddy areas, biogenic habitats at varied depths) contribute to niche diversity, and thus biodiversity. Major bathymetric clines associated with elevated topography produce gradients that shape ecological traits including species richness, community structure, abundance, biomass and trophic modes.

# Distribution

About 171000 seamounts, knolls and hills documented so far worldwide cover c. 2.6% of the seafloor. Ridges cover about 9.2% of the seafloor, along a semi-continuous system 55,000 km long.

## Map details

The indicative map of Seamounts, ridges and plateaus was based on the ‘seamounts’, ‘ridges’ and ‘plateaus’ geomorphic units of Harris et al. (2014).
