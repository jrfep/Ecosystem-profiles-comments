# Ecological traits

These low-productivity, net heterotrophic systems are founded on unstable rocky substrates, sharing some ecological features with sandy beaches (TM1.3) and others with rocky shores (TM1.1). Traits of the biota reflect responses to regular substrate disturbance by waves and exposure of particle surfaces to desiccation and high temperatures. For example, in the high intertidal zone of boulder shores where temperature and desiccation stress is most pronounced, fauna may be predominantly nocturnal. On cobble beaches fauna are more abundant sub-surface because waves cause cobbles on the surface to grind against each other, damaging or killing attached fauna (cf. sandy beaches where most fauna occupy surface sediments). In general, intermediate frequencies of disturbance lead to greatest biodiversity. Generally only species with low tenacity (e.g. top shells) are found in surface sediments because they can detach and temporarily inhabit deeper interstices during disturbance events. High-tenacity species such as limpets or sessile species such as macroalgae and barnacles are more readily damaged, and hence rare on cobble shores.  Large boulders, however, are  only disturbed during large storms so larger numbers of fauna can persist on their surface. Encrusting organisms may cement together boulders on the low-shore, further stabilizing them in turbulent water. In general, allochthonously derived wrack is the major source of organic matter on cobble beaches, however, in situ autotrophs include superficial algae and vascular vegetation dominated by halophytic forbs, which may occur on the berm. On some cobble beaches of New England, USA, extensive intertidal beds of the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora are able to stabilize cobbles and provide shading, facilitating the establishment of mussels, barnacles, gastropods, amphipods, crabs, and algae. In stabilising cobbles and buffering wave energy, cordgrass may also facilitate plants higher on the intertidal shore.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Particle size (e.g. cobbles vs boulders) and wave activity determine substrate mobility and hence the frequency of physical disturbance to biota. Ecosystem engineers may modify these relationships by stabilising the substratum. Cobble beaches are typically steep because waves easily flow through large interstices between coarse beach particles, reducing effects of backwash erosion. The permeability of cobble beaches leads to desiccation and heat stress at low tide along a gradient on the beach surface from the low shore to high intertidal. Desiccation stress is also extreme on boulder shores, playing a similar role in structuring communities as on rocky shores.  The extent of the fine sediment matrix present amongst cobbles, water supply (i.e. rainfall), and the frequency of physical disturbance all influence beach vegetation.

# Distribution

Cobble beaches occur where rivers deliver large quantities of cobbles to the coast or where they are eroded from nearby coastal cliffs. They are most common in Europe, also occurring in Bahrain, North America and New Zealand's South Island.

{% capture map_det %} Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) containing Rocky shorelines, Sandy shorelines and Boulder and cobble shorelines were identified by consulting regional substrate maps and expertise of authors. These were clipped to the extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014). {% endcapture %}
