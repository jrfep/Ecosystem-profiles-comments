# Ecosystem properties

These low-productivity, net heterotrophic systems are founded on unstable rocky substrates and share some ecological features with sandy beaches (MT1.3) and rocky shores (MT1.1). Traits of the biota reflect responses to regular substrate disturbance by waves and exposure of particles to desiccation and high temperatures. For example, in the high intertidal zone of boulder shores (where temperature and desiccation stress is most pronounced), fauna may be predominantly nocturnal. On cobble beaches, fauna are more abundant on the sub-surface because waves cause cobbles to grind against each other, damaging or killing attached fauna. Conversely, sandy beaches are where most fauna occupy surface sediments. Intermediate frequencies of disturbance lead to the greatest biodiversity. Only species with low tenacity (e.g. top shells) are found in surface sediments because they can detach and temporarily inhabit deeper interstices during disturbance events. High-tenacity species (e.g. limpets) or sessile species (e.g. macroalgae and barnacles) are more readily damaged, hence rare on cobble shores. Large boulders, however, are only disturbed during large storms and have more stable temperatures, so more fauna can persist on their surface. Encrusting organisms may cement boulders on the low shore, further stabilising them in turbulent water. Allochthonous wrack is the major source of organic matter on cobble beaches, but in situ autotrophs include superficial algae and vascular vegetation dominated by halophytic forbs. On some cobble beaches of New England, USA, extensive intertidal beds of the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stabilise cobbles and provide shade, facilitating establishment of mussels, barnacles, gastropods, amphipods, crabs, and algae. In stabilising cobbles and buffering wave energy, cordgrass may also facilitate plants higher on the intertidal shore.

# Ecological Drivers

Particle size (e.g. cobbles vs. boulders) and wave activity determine substrate mobility, hence the frequency of physical disturbance to biota. Ecosystem engineers modify these relationships by stabilising the substrate. Cobble beaches are typically steep because waves easily flow through large interstices between coarse beach particles, reducing the effects of backwash erosion. Hence swash and breaking zones tend to be similar widths. The permeability of cobble beaches leads to desiccation and heat stress at low tide along the beach surface gradient. Desiccation stress is extreme on boulder shores, playing a similar role in structuring communities as on rocky shores. The extent of the fine sediment matrix present amongst cobbles, water supply (i.e. rainfall), and the frequency of physical disturbance all influence beach vegetation. Alongshore grading of sediment by size could occur on long, drift dominated shorelines, which may influence sediment calibre on the beach.

# Distribution

Cobble beaches occur where rivers or glaciers delivered cobbles to the coast or where they were eroded from nearby coastal cliffs. They are most common in Europe and also occur in Bahrain, North America, and New Zealandâ€™s South Island.
