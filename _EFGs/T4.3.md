# Ecological traits

These open woodlands are dominated by C4 hummock grasses (C3 and stoloniferous grasses absent) with sclerophyllous trees and shrubs. Their primary productivity is lower-and  less regularly seasonal than other savannas of the subtropics (T4.1, T4.2), but the seasonal peak nonetheless coincides with summer monsoonal rains. Plant traits promote tolerance of seasonal drought, including reduced leaf surfaces, thick cuticles, sunken stomates and deep root architecture to access subsoil moisture. Deciduous leaf phenology is less common than in other savannas, likely due to selection pressure for nutrient conservation associated with oligotrophic substates. A major feature distinguishing this group of savannas from others is its groundlayer of slow-growing sclerophyllous, spiny, domed hummock grasses interspersed with bare ground. Woody biomass and LAI decline along rainfall gradients. Sclerophyll shrubs and trees are shade-intolerant during establishment and most possess fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark, epicormic meristematic tissues, below-ground bud banks). Their notophyll foliage and that of hummock grasses has low SLA and high C:N ratios. Trophic structure is therefore simpler than in others savannas. Mammalian herbivores and their predators are present in low densities, but fire and invertebrates are the major biomass consumers. Fire promotes landscape-scale vegetation heterogeneity, but occurs less frequently than in other savannas due to slow recovery of perennial hummock grass fuels. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition due to recurring fires.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Large overall rainfall deficit up to c. 2000mm, always with a seasonal (winter) drought, but in drier areas seasonality is weaker than in other savanna groups. Mean annual rainfall is generally 400-1000mm. Climatic water deficit is exacerbated by coarse-textured usually shallow, rocky soils. These are characteristically infertile. Temperatures are warm-hot with moderate seasonal and diurnal variability. Fires promoted by flammable hummocks may consume the low tree canopies and occur at decadal to multi-decadal intervals any time when it is dry, but fire spread depends on ground fuel continuity which is limited by rainfall and rocky terrain.

Rocky areas of the seasonal Australian tropics extending to the semi-arid zone.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
