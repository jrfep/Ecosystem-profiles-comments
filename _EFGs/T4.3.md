Found only in northern Australia, hummock savannas are distinguished by a ground layer of slow-growing, domed hummock grasses interspersed with bare ground and some trees and shrubs. These habitats are less strongly seasonal than other savannas, but still with winter droughts and summer rains, and many plant adaptations to seasonal drought. Recurring fires are an important factor promoting patchiness of vegetation, but post-fire recovery is slower than other savanna ecosystems. Rocky coarse-textured substrates are low in nutrients. Foodwebs are correspondingly simple, with large numbers of invertebrates and low numbers of mammalian herbivores and vertebrate predators.

### Key Features

Sparse to open low-productivity woodlands in nutrient poor often rocky landscapes with C4 hummock grasses, rich reptile fauna, abundant termites, moderate herbivore densities and irregular fires..

### Distribution

Restricted to northern Australia in the wet-dry and semi-arid tropics..
