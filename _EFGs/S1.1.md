# Ecological traits

Dark subterranean air-filled voids support simple, low productivity systems. . The trophic network is truncated and dominated by heterotrophs, with no representation of photosynthetic primary producers or herbivores. Diversity is low, comprising detritivores and their pathogens and predators, although there may be a few specialist predators essentially confined to resource-rich hotspots. Biota include invertebrates (notably beetles, springtails and arachnids), fungi, bacteria and transient vertebrates, notably bats, which use surface-connected caves as roosts and breeding sites. Bacteria and fungi form biofilm on rock surfaces. Fungi are most abundant in humid microsites. Some are parasites and many are critical food sources for invertebrates and protozoans. Allochthonous energy and nutrients are, imported via seepage moisture, tree roots, bats and other winged animals. This leads to fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in resource distribution, reflected in patterns of biotic diversity and abundance. Chemautotrophic proteobacteria are prominent in hypogean caves formed by sulphide springs. They fix carbon through sulphide oxidation, producing sulphuric acid and gypsum residue in snottite draperies, accelerating chemical corrosion. The majority of biota are obligate hypogean organisms that complete their life cycles below ground. These are generalist detritivores and some are also opportunistic predators, reflecting selection pressures of food scarcity. Distinctive traits include specialised non-visual sensory organs, reduced eyes, pigmentation and wings, elongated appendages, long life spans, slow metabolism and growth, and low fecundity. Other cave taxa are temporary below-ground inhabitants, have populations that live entirely above- or below-ground or life cycles necessitating use of both environments. The specialist hypogean taxa belong to relatively few evolutionary lineages that either persisted as relics in caves after extinction of epigean relatives, or diversified after colonisation by epigean ancestors. Although diversity is low, local endemism is high, reflecting insularity and limited connectivity between cave systems.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Most caves form from chemical weathering of limestone or gypsum, either epigenically from surface waters or hypogenically from phreatic waters. Caves also derive from lava tubes and other substrates. Characteristics include the absence of light except at openings, low variability in temperature and humidity, and scarcity of nutrients. High physical fragmentation of cave substrates limits biotic connectivity and promotes insular evolution in stable conditions.

# Distribution

Scattered worldwide, but mostly northern hemisphere, in limestones (map), basalt flows and rarely other lithic substrates.

## Map details

Distributions of Aerobic caves were based on mapped area of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016). This. provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain, as not all carbonate rocks are karstified. Lava tubes and other rocks that may contain these ecosystem functional groups are not shown on this indicative map, but are less extensive than those in carbonate rock.
