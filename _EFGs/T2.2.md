# Ecological traits


 These structurally simple, winter deciduous forests have high productivity and LAI in summer. Winter dormancy, hibernation and migration are common life histories among plants and animals enabling cold avoidance. Local endemism is comparatively low and there are modest levels of diversity across most major taxa. The forest canopy is comprised of at least two-thirds deciduous broad-leaf foliage (notophylll-mesophyll) with high SLA and up to one-third evergreen (typically needle-leaf) cover. As well as deciduous woody forms, annual turnover of above-ground biomass also occurs some in non-woody geophytic and other ground flora, which is insulated from cold beneath winter snow and flowers soon after melt before tree canopy closure. Annual leaf turnover is sustained by fertile substrates and water surplus, with nutrient withdrawal from foliage and storage of starch prior to fall. Tissues are protected from cold by supercooling rather than extra-cellular freeze-tolerance. Dormant buds are insulated from frost by bracts or by burial below soil in some non-woody plants. Fungal and microbial decomposers play vital roles in cycling carbon and nutrients in the soil surface horizon. Despite highly seasonal primary productivity, the trophic network includes large browsing herbivores (deer), smaller granivores and herbivores (rodents, hares) and mammalian predators (canids, felines). Most invertebrates are seasonally active. Behavioural and life history traits enabling of animals to persist through cold winters, include dense winter fur, food caching, winter foraging, hibernation, dormant life phases and migration. Migratory animals provide allochthonous subsidies of energy and nutrients, and promote incidental dispersal of other biota. Browsing mammals and insects are major consumers of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Deciduous trees may be early colonisers of disturbed areas later replaced by evergreens, but are also stable occupants across large temperate regions. Tree recruitment is limited by spring frost, allelopathy and herbivory, and occurs semi-continuously in gaps. Herbivores may influence densities of deciduous forest canopies by regulating tree regeneration. Deciduous leaf fall may exert allelopathic control over tree seedlings and seasonal ground flora.


# Key-ecological-drivers


 Phenological processes in these forests are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges, (mean winter temperatures <-1°C, summer means  up to 22°C), typically with substantial winter snow and limited growing season, with 4-6 months above 10°C, and severe post-thaw frosts. Fertile soils, especially with high N levels, and an overall water surplus, support deciduous leaf turnover. Fires are generally uncommon.

Cool temperate Europe (southwest Russia to British Isles), northeast Asia (northeast China, southern Siberia Korea, Japan) northeast America. Limited occurrences in warm temperate zones of south Europe and Asia, and midwest USA.


## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews (cited in respective reference sections of profiles), maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
