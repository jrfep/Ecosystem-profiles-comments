# Short description

At cool temperate latitudes in the Northern hemisphere, fertile soils and high precipitation support forests dominated by broadleaf deciduous trees, although evergreen needleleaf trees may account for up to one-third of the canopy. Cold snow-prone winters punctuate a limited but highly productive growing season. Fungi and bacteria play vital roles in decomposition of the seasonal leaf fall on the forest floor, with insects and browsing herbivores important in carbon and nutrient cycling. Herbivores such as deer and hares are prey to feline, canine and avian predators. Winter dormancy, hibernation and migration are key strategies enabling survival of plants and animals.

# Key Features

Closed canopy broadleaved forests in seasonally warm and cold humid climates, with low to moderate woody species diversity

# Distribution

Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, limited occurrences in southern South America
