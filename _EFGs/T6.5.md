# Ecological traits


Treeless mountain systems dominated by an open to dense cover of cold-tolerant C3 perennial tussock grasses, herbs, small shrubs and distinctive arborescent rosette or cushion growth forms.  Lichens and bryophytes are also common. Productivity is low, dependent on autochthonous energy and limited by cold temperatures, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles and desiccating conditions, but not by a short growing season (cf . T6.4). Elfin forms of tropical montane forests (T1.3) occupy sheltered gullies and lower elevations. Diversity is low-moderate but endemism is high among some taxa, reflecting, steep elevational gradients, microhabitat heterogeneity and topographic insularity, which restricts dispersal. Solifluction restricts seedling establishment to stable microsites. Plants have traits to protect buds, leaves and reproductive tissues from diurnal cold and transient desiccation stress, including ramulose, cushion and rosette growth forms, insulation from marcescent leaves or pectin fluids, diminutive leaf sizes, leaf pubescence, water storage in stem-pith and vegetative propagation. Most plants are long-lived and some rosette forms are semelparous. Cuticle and epidermal layers reduce UV-B transmissiion to photosynthetic tissues. Plant coexistence is mediated by Interactions among competition, facilitation, herbivory (vertebrate and invertebrate) and fire regimes. Simple trophic networks include itinerant large herbivores and predators from adjacent lowland savannas as well as resident reptiles, small mammals and macro-invertebrates.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Cold nights (as low as -10°C) and mild days (up to 15°C) produce low mean temperatures and diurnal freeze/thaw cycles, but seasonal temperature range is small and freezing temperatures are short-lived. Cloud cover and precipitation are aseasonal in equatorial latitudes or seasonal in the monsoonal tropics. Strong orographic effects result in an overall precipitation surplus and snow and fog are common, but desiccating conditions may occur during intervals between precipitation events, with morning insolation also increasing moisture stress when roots are cold. Exposure to UV-B radiation is very high. Substrates are typically rocky and shallow with low moisture retention capacity, and exposed to solifluction. However, microtopographic heterogeneity influences fine-scale spatial variation in moisture availability. Steep slopes are subjected to periodic mass movements, which destroy surface vegetation. Low intensity fires may be ignited by lightning or spread upslope from lowland savannas, but occur infrequently at multi-decadal intervals.


# Distribution


Restricted mountain areas of tropical Central and South America, east and west Africa and southeast Asia.


## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
