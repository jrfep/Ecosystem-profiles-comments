# Ecological traits

The epipelagic or euphotic zone of the open ocean is the uppermost layer that is penetrated by enough light to support photosynthesis. The vast area of the ocean means that autochthonous productivity in the epipelagic layer accounts for around half of all global carbon fixation. This in turn supports a complex trophic network and high biomass of crustaceans, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals and seabirds, including fast-swimming, visual predators taking advantage of the high-light environment. The suitability of conditions for successful recruitment and reproduction of local species depends on characteristics of the water column, which vary spatially and impact productivity rates, species composition and size-structure of the community. Mid-ocean subtropical gyres, for example, are characteristically oligotrophic, with lower diversity and productivity than other parts of the ocean surface. In contrast to the rest of the epipelagic zone upwelling zones are characterised by different and specific patterns of water movement that drive high nutrient levels, productivity, and abundant forage fish, and are therefore included in a different functional group (M1.9). The habitat and life cycle of some specialised pelagic species (e.g. flying fish) are entirely contained within epipelagic ocean waters, but many commonly occurring crustaceans, fish and cephalopods undertake either diel or ontogenetic vertical migration between the epipelagic and deeper oceanic layers. These organisms exploit the food available in the productive epipelagic zone either at night, when predation risk is lower, or for the entirety of their less mobile, juvenile life stages. Horizontal migration is also common, and some species (e.g. tuna, migratory whales) swim long distances (hundreds or thousands of km) to feed and reproduce. Other species utilize horizontal currents for passive migration, particularly smaller planktonic organisms or life stages, e.g. small pelagic fish (sardine and anchovy) larvae moving between spawning and feeding grounds. Unconsumed plankton and dead organisms sink from this upper oceanic zone, providing an important source of nutrients to lower, aphotic zones.

# Key-ecological-drivers

The epipelagic zone is structured by a strong depth gradient in light. Depth is variable based on local turbidity, but extends to approximately 200m where light attenuates to 1% of surface levels. Interaction at the surface between the ocean and atmosphere leads to increased seasonality, mixing and warming, and makes this the most biologically and physicochemically variable ocean layer. Nutrient levels are highly spatially variable as a result. Salinity varies with terrestrial freshwater inputs, evaporation and mixing, with greater variation in semi-enclosed areas (e.g. Mediterranean Sea) than the open ocean.

## Map details

Indicative distributions of these marine pelagic ecosystem functional groups were derived from bathymetric spatial data obtained from Becker et al. (2009) using depth range thresholds cited in respective descriptive profiles for each functional group.
