# Ecosystem properties

These mixed graminoid shrublands are restricted to cool-temperate maritime environments. Typically, the vegetation cover is >70% and mostly less than 1-m tall, dominated by low, semi-sclerophyllous shrubs with ferns and C3 graminoids. Shrub foliage is mostly evergreen and ericoid, with low SLA or reduced to spiny stems. Modular growth forms are common among shrubs and grasses. Diversity and local endemism are low across taxa and the trophic network is relatively simple. Primary productivity is low, based on autochthonous energy sources and limited by cold temperatures and low-fertility acid soils rather than by water deficit (as in other heathlands, biome T3). Seasonally low light may limit productivity at the highest latitudes. Cool temperatures and low soil oxygen due to periodically wet subsoil limit decomposition by microbes and fungi so that soils accumulate organic matter despite low productivity. Mammalian browsers including cervids, lagomorphs, and camelids (South America) consume local plant biomass but subsidise autochthonous energy with carbon and nutrients consumed in more productive forest or anthropogenic ecosystems adjacent to the heathlands. Browsers and recurring low-intensity fires appear to be important in top-down regulatory processes that prevent the transition to forest, as is anthropogenic fire, grazing, and tree removal. Canids and raptors are the main vertebrate predators. Other characteristic vertebrate fauna include ground-nesting birds and rodents. At least some communities exhibit autogenic cyclical patch dynamics in which shrubs and grasses are alternately dominant, senescent, and regenerating.

# Ecological Drivers

Unlike most other heathlands, these ecosystems have an overall water surplus, though sometimes with small summer deficits. Mild summers and cold winters with periodic snow are tempered by maritime climatic influences. A short day length and low solar angle limits energy influx at the highest latitudes. Severe coastal storms with high winds occur periodically. Acid soils, typically with high humic content in upper horizons, are often limited in N and P. Low-intensity fires recur at decadal time scales or rarely. Some northern European heaths were derived from forest and return to forest when burning and grazing ceases.

# Distribution

Boreal and cool temperate coasts of western Europe and America, the Azores, and the Magellanic region of South America, mostly at >40Â° latitude, except where transitional with warm-temperate heaths (e.g. France and Spain).
