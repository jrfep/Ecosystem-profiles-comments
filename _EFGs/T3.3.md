# Ecological Traits
 
These mixed graminoid shrublands are restricted to cool temperate maritime environments. Typically, the vegetation cover is >70% and mostly less than 1 m tall, dominated by low semi-sclerophyllous shrubs with ferns and C3 graminoids. Shrub foliage is mostly evergreen, ericoid, with low SLA. Modular growth forms are common among shrubs and grasses. Diversity and local endemism are low across taxa and the trophic network is relatively simple. Primary productivity is low, based on autochthonous energy sources and limited by seasonally low light and cold temperatures, and low fertility acid soils, rather than water deficit (as in other heathlands T3). Cool temperatures and anoxic conditions due to periodically high water tables limit decomposition by microbes and fungi so that soils accumulate organic matter despite low productivity. Mammalian  browsers including cervids, lagomorphs and camelids (South America) consume some local plant biomass, but subsidise autochthonous energy with carbon and nutrients consumed in more productive forest ecosystems adjacent to the heathlands. Browsers and recurring low-intensity fires appear to be important in top-down regulatory processes that prevent transition to forest, as is anthropogenic fire, grazing and tree removal. Canids and raptors are the main vertebrate predators. Other characteristic vertebrate fauna include ground-nesting birds and rodents. At least some communities exhibit cyclical patch dynamics in which shrubs and grasses are alternately dominant, senescent and regenerating.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Unlike most other heathlands, these ecosystems have an overall water surplus, though sometimes with small summer deficits. Mild summers and cold winters with periodic snow are tempered by maritime climatic influences. A short daylength and low solar angle limits energy influx at the highest latitudes. Severe coastal storms with high winds occur periodically. Acid soils, typically with high humic content in upper horizons, are often limited in N & P. Low intensity fires recur at decadal time scales or rarely.

# Distribution
 
Boreal and cool temperate coasts of western Europe and America, Azores, Magellanic region of South America, mostly at latitudes >40° latitude except where transitional with warm temperate heaths (e.g. France-Spain).

Distribution of Cool temperate heathlands was assembled from ecosystem distribution map of Europe (European Commision 2016), landcover and ecoregions maps of North America (CEC 1997; Latifovic et al. 2016) and vegetation map from Chile (Luebert and Pliscoff 2006). Occurrences were then aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and reclassified as major occurrences (>60% occurrence) and minor occurrences (< 60% occurrence).
