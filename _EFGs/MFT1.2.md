# Ecological Traits
 
Mangroves are structural engineers of these systems and possess traits including pneumatophores, salt excretion glands, vivipary and propagule buoyancy that promote survival and recruitment in poorly aerated, saline, mobile, tidally inundated substrates. These systems are among the most productive in coastal environments. They produce large amounts of detritus (e.g. leaves, twigs, bark), some of which becomes buried in water-logged sediments and some of which enters trophic pathways, consumed by crabs or more commonly decomposed by fungi and bacteria, which in turn mobilise carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Although highly productive, these ecosystems are typically less speciose than other coastal biogenic systems. Crabs are among the most abundant and important invertebrates. Their burrows oxygenate sediments, enhance groundwater penetration and provide habitat for other invertebrates such as molluscs and worms. Prop and/or peg (pneumatophore) roots provide a complex habitat structure that protects juvenile fishes from predators and serves as hard substrate for the attachment of algae as well as sessile and mobile invertebrates such as oysters and mussels, sponges and gastropods. Mangrove canopies support terrestrial biota including air-breathing invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals as well as extensive bird communities. These are highly dynamic systems, with species distributions adjusting to local changes in sediment distribution, tidal regimes and local inundation and salinity gradients.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Mangroves are physiologically intolerant of low temperatures, which excludes them from regions where mean air temperature of the coldest months is below 20°C, where the seasonal temperature range exceeds 10°C, or where ground frost occurs. Regional distributions are influenced by interactions among landscape position, rainfall, hydrology, sea level, sediment dynamics, subsidence, storm driven processes and disturbance by pests and predators. Rainfall and sediment supply from rivers and currents promote mangrove establishment and persistence, while waves and large tidal currents destabilise and erode mangrove substrates, mediating local-scale dynamism in ecosystem distribution. High rainfall reduces salinity stress and increases nutrient loading from adjacent catchments, while tidal flushing also regulates salinity.

# Distribution
 
Widely distributed along tropical and warm temperate coastlines of the world. Large-scale currents may prevent buoyant seeds from reaching some areas.
