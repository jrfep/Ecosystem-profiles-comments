# Ecological Traits
 
These low-productivity ecosystems include aquifers (underground layers of water-saturated permeable rock or unconsolidated gravel, sand, or silt) and hyporheic zones of saturated sediments beneath rivers and lakes. Taxonomic diversity is low, but increases with connectivity to surface waters. Nonetheless, microbial communities are functionally diverse, and invertebrate taxa exhibit high levels of local endemism where aquifers are poorly connected. Trophic networks are truncated and comprised almost exclusively of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates. Chemautotrophic bacteria are the only source of autochthonous energy. Herbivores are only present where plant material enters the groundwater system (e.g. in well-connected hyporheic zones). Microbes and their protozoan predators dwell on particle surfaces rather than in the pore water. They play key roles in weathering and mineral formation, engineer chemically distinctive microhabitats through redox reactions and are repositories of carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen within the system. Meiofaunal detritivores and predators transfer carbon and nutrients from biofilms to larger invertebrate predators, such as crustaceans, annelids, nematodes, water mites and beetles. These larger trophic generalists live in interstitial waters, either browsing on particle biofilms or ingesting sediment grains, digesting their surface microbes and excreting the ‘cleaned’ grains. They have morphological and behavioural traits that equip them for life in dark, resource-scarce groundwater where free space is limited. These include slow metabolism and growth, long life spans without resting stages, low fecundity, lack of pigmentation, reduced eyes, enhanced non-optic sensory organs and elongated body shapes with enhanced segmentation. Much of the biota belongs to ancient subterranean lineages that have diverged sympatrically within aquifers or allopatrically from repeated colonisations or aquifer fragmentation.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Groundwater ecosystems are characterised by a scarcity of nutrients, carbon, dissolved oxygen and free space, and an absence of light. Groundwater flow, pore size, interstitial biogeochemistry and hydrological conductivity to adjacent aquifers and surface waters determine ecosystem properties. Subsurface water residence times vary from days in shallow, well-connected, coarse-grained hyporheic systems to thousands of years in deep, poorly connected aquifers confined between impermeable rock strata. Disconnectivity promotes insularity and endemism, as well as reductive biogeochemical processes that influence availability of food and nutrients.
