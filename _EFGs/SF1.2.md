# Ecological Traits
 
These low-productivity ecosystems are found within or below groundwater (phreatic) zones. They include aquifers (underground layers of water-saturated permeable rock or unconsolidated gravel, sand, or silt) and hyporheic zones beneath rivers and lakes (i.e. where shallow groundwater and surface water mix). Diversity and abundance of biota decline with depth and connectivity to surface waters, as do nutrients (e.g. most meiofauna is limited to 100m depth). Microbial communities are functionally diverse and invertebrate taxa exhibit high local endemism where aquifers are poorly connected. Trophic networks are truncated and comprised almost exclusively of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates. Chemoautotrophic bacteria are the only source of autochthonous energy. Herbivores only occur where plant material enters groundwater systems (e.g. in well-connected hyporheic zones). Microbes and their protozoan predators dwell on particle surfaces rather than in pore water. They play key roles in weathering and mineral formation, engineer chemically distinctive microhabitats through redox reactions, and are repositories of Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus within the ecosystem. Meio-faunal detritivores and predators transfer Carbon and nutrients from biofilms to larger invertebrate predators such as crustaceans, annelids, nematodes, water mites, and beetles. These larger trophic generalists live in interstitial waters, either browsing on particle biofilms or ingesting sediment grains, digesting their surface microbes, and excreting ‘cleaned’ grains. They have morphological and behavioural traits that equip them for life in dark, resource-scarce groundwater where space is limited. These include slow metabolism and growth, long lifespans without resting stages, low fecundity, lack of pigmentation, reduced eyes, enhanced non-optic sensory organs, and elongated body shapes with enhanced segmentation. Much of the biota belongs to ancient subterranean lineages that have diverged sympatrically within aquifers or allopatrically from repeated colonisations or aquifer fragmentation.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Groundwater ecosystems are characterised by a scarcity of nutrients, Carbon, dissolved oxygen and free space, and an absence of light. They occur within basin fill or other porous geological strata. Groundwater flow, pore size, interstitial biogeochemistry, and hydrological conductivity to adjacent aquifers and surface waters determine ecosystem properties. Subsurface water residence times vary from days in shallow, well-connected, coarse-grained hyporheic systems to thousands of years in deep, poorly connected aquifers confined between impermeable rock strata. Lack of connectivity promotes insularity and endemism as well as reductive biogeochemical processes that influence the availability of food and nutrients.
