# Ecological Traits
 
Anchialine pools, like anchialine caves (SM1.1), are tidally influenced bodies of brackish water with subterranean connections to the sea and groundwater, but with significant or full exposure to open air and sunlight. They have no surface connection to the ocean or freshwater ecosystems. Younger anchialine pools are exposed to abundant sunlight, characterized by relatively low productivity, and tend to support only benthic microalgae, cyanobacteria, and primary consumers. Older pools with more established biological communities have higher productivity with a wider range of autotrophs, including macroalgae, aquatic monocots, established riparian and canopy vegetation, and primary and secondary consumers. High productivity is attributed to a combination of sunlight exposure, rugose substrates, and relatively high natural concentrations of inorganic nutrients from groundwater. Anchialine pools may support complex benthic microbial communities, primary consumers, filter-feeders, detritivores, scavengers and secondary consumers. These consumers are primarily molluscs and crustaceans, several of which are anchialine obligates. Due to connections with deeper hypogeal habitats, obligate species may display physical and physiological traits similar to anchialine cave species. However, larger predatory fish and birds also utilize anchialine pools for food and habitat. Anchialine pools are ecologically dynamic systems due to their openness, connections with surrounding terrestrial habitats and subterranean hydrologic connections. Consequently, they are inherently sensitive to ecological phase shifts throughout their relatively ephemeral existence, with senescence initiating in as little as 100 years. However, new anchialine pools may form within a few months after basaltic lava flows. 
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Anchialine pools form from subterranean mixing of seawater and groundwater, primarily through porous basalt or limestone substrates, and more rarely other lithic substrates. Tidal influences can drive large fluctuations in water level and salinity on a daily cycle, but are typically dampened with increased distance from the ocean. Sunlight, UV exposure and other environmental characteristics vary within anchialine pools and haloclines are common. The pools can also be connected to anchialine cave systems (SM1.1) through tension fissures in basalt flows, and collapsed openings in lava tubes.

# Distribution
 
Scattered worldwide, mostly in the northern hemisphere. Many well- known examples occur in Hawaii, Palau and Indonesia, volcanic cracks or grietas in the Galapagos Islands, and open-air entrance pools of anchialine caves (e.g. cenotes in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and blue holes in the Bahamas).

Indicative distributions of Anchialine caves and pools were based on mapped areas of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016) and lava flows intersecting the coast, which were aggregated within a template of 1-degree grid cells.
