# Ecological traits

Shallow ephemeral freshwater bodies are also known as depressions, playas, clay pans or pans. Long periods of low productivity during dry phases are punctuated by episodes of high production after filling. Trophic structure is relatively simple with mostly benthic, filamentous and planktonic algae contributing in situ primary production, with detritivorous and predatory zooplankton (rotifers, Daphnia), crustaceans, insects and in somelakes, molluscs. The often high invertebrate biomass provides food for amphibians and itinerant waterbirds. Terrestrial mammals use the lakes to drink and bathe, and may transfer nutrients, organic matter and ’hitch-hiking’ biota. Diversity may be high in boom phases, but there are only a few local endemics (e.g. narrow range charophytes). Specialised and opportunistic biota exploit boom-bust resource availability through life-cycle traits that confer tolerance to desiccation (e.g.  desiccation-resistant e.g. in crustacea) and/or enable rapid hatching, development, breeding and recruitment when water arrives. Much of the biota (e.g. opportunistic insects) have widely dispersing adult phases enabling rapid colonisation and recolonisation. Filling events initiate succession with spikes of primary production allowing short temporal windows for consumers to grow and reproduce and for itinerant predators to aggregate. Drying initiates senescence, dispersal and dormancy, until the next filling event.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Arid climates have highly variable hydrology. Episodic inundation after rain is relatively short (days to months) due to high evaporation rates and infiltration. Drainage systems are closed or nearly so, with channels or sheet inflow from flat, sparsely vegetated catchments. Inflows bring allochthonous organic matter and nutrients, and are typically turbid with fine particles. Clay-textured lake bottoms hold water by limiting percolation, but may include sand particles. Bottom sediments release nutrients rapidly after filling. The lakes are shallow and flat-bottomed with small volumes, so light and oxygen are generally not limiting. Persistent turbidity may limit light in the lake waters, but oxygen production by macrophytes and flocculation from increasing salinity during drying reduce turbidity over time. Shallow depth promotes high daytime water temperatures (when filling in summer) and high diurnal temperature variability.

Semi-arid and arid regions at mid latitudes of the Americas, Africa, west and Asia and Australia.

{% capture map_det %} Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of rivers and streams were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors. {% endcapture %}
