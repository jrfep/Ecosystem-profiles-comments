# Ecological Traits
 
Canals, ditches and storm water drains are artificial streams with low horizontal and vertical heterogeneity. They function as rivers or streams and may have simplified habitat structure and trophic networks, though some older ditches have fringing vegetation, which contributes to structural complexity. The main primary producers are filamentous algae and macrophytes that thrive on allochthonous subsidies of nutrients. Subsidies of organic carbon from urban or rural landscapes support microbial decomposers and mostly small invertebrate detritivores. While earthen banks and linings may support macrophytes and a rich associated fauna, sealed or otherwise uniform substrates limit the diversity and abundance of benthic biota. Fish and crustacean communities, when present, generally exhibit lower diversity and smaller body sizes compared to natural systems, and are often dominated by introduced or invasive species. Waterbirds, when present, typically include a low diversity and density of herbivorous and piscivorous species. Canals, ditches and drains may provide pathways for dispersal or colonisation of native and invasive biota.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Engineered levees and channels enable managed water flow for human uses, including water delivery for irrigation or recreation, water removal from poorly drained sites or sealed surfaces (e.g. storm water drains), or routes for navigation. Deterministic water regimes and often shallow depths have major influences on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the canals, ditches and drains. Flows in some ditches may be very slow, approaching lentic regimes. Flows in storm water drains vary with rain or other inputs. Irrigation, transport, or recreation canals usually have steady perennial flows but may be seasonal for irrigation or intermittent where the water source is small. Turbidity varies but oxygen content is usually high. Substrates and banks vary from earthen material or hard surfaces (e.g. concrete, bricks), affecting suitability for macrophytes and niche diversity. The water may carry high levels of nutrients and pollutants due to inflow and sedimentation from sealed surfaces, sewerage, other waste sources, fertilised cropping, or pasture lands.

Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing major or minor occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identifed in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. The selections were check by expert reviewers. Occurrences were mapped at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution.
