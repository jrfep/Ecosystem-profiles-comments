# Ecological traits

Structurally simple, low-diversity, high-productivity pastures are, maintained by intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients, more rarely water, and artificial disturbance regimes (periodic ploughing,), translocation (e.g. sowing, livestock movement) and harvesting of animals and/or plants. They are dominated by one or few selected plant (usually C3 perennial pasture grasses and/or herbaceous legumes) and animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores) for commercial production of food or materials, ornamental display or rarely subsistence. Their composition and structure is maintained by translocations and/or managed reproduction of target species and periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores and/or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have low functional and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators and diseases. They are harvested by humans continuously or periodically for consumption. Major examples include intensively managed production pastures for livestock or forage (hay), lawns and sporting fields. Livestock pastures may be rotated interannually with non-woody crops (T7.1). Target biota coexists with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota that is able to exploit production landscapes through efficient dispersal, rapid establishment, high fecundity and rapid population turnover. When actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively, this non-target biota becomes dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel systems.

# Key-ecological-drivers

High to moderate natural availability of water (from rainfall) and nutrients (from soil fertility) is supplemented by human inputs via water management, landscape drainage modifications (surface earthworks) and/or fertiliser application by humans. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Typically associated with moderately fertile substrates and flat to undulating terrain, accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. ploughing up to 5years/decade), maintaining soil turnover, aeration and nutrient release.

# Distribution

Mostly in subtropical to temperate climatic zones and developed countries across Europe, east and south Asia, subtropical and temperate Africa, southern Australasia, north and central America and temperate south America.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
