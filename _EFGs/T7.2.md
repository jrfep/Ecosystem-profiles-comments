In these intensively managed agricultural systems, grasses and legumes are sown and cultivated, with regular inputs of nutrients and (sometimes) water, primary for the mostly commercial production of livestock or food (hay) for livestock. Sown pastures are structurally simple ecosystems with low-diversity and high-productivity. They are dominated by one or few selected plant species as primary food sources for one animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores). Management includes chemical or physical treatments to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, or pathogens. They differ from less intensively managed rangeland (e.g. biome T5) and semi-natural grasslands (T7.5), where livestock graze in predominantly native ecosystems.

### Key Features

Structurally simple, very low- diversity, high-productivity grasslands dominated by one or few species of perennial grasses (Poacaeae) maintained by intensive addition of nutrients, water and artificial disturbance regimes (mowing or grazing).

### Distribution

Abundant in humid or sub-humid, boreal to tropical climates worldwide.
