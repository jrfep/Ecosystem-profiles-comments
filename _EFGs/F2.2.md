With a surface area of up to 100 km<sup>2</sup>, the diversity of small permanent lakes, ponds and pools depends on their size, depth and connectivity. Littoral vegetation and benthic energy pathways are critical to productivity and food web complexity. Deep lakes have plankton, supporting fish, birds and frogs, in different habitats of the lake. Shallow lakes are often more productive, providing breeding habitat for birds, frogs and reptiles, but limited buffering against nutrient inputs may result in regime shifts between alternative stable states dominated either by large aquatic plants or phytoplankton.

### Key Features

Small permanent freshwater lakes or ponds with niche diversity strongly related to size and depth, and resource subsidies from catchments. Littoral zones and benthic macrophytes are important contributors to productivity.

### Overview of distribution

Predominantly in humid temperate and tropical regions.
