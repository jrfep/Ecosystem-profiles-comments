# Ecological traits

Small permanent freshwater lakes, pools or ponds are lentic environments with relatively high perimeter to surface area and surface area to volume ratios. Most are less than 1 km2 in area, but this functional group includes lakes of transitional sizes up to 100 km2, while the largest lakes (>100 km2) are classified in F2.1. Niche diversity increases with lake size; the most diverse lakes support phytoplankton, zooplankton, shallow-water macrophytes (in), invertebrates, sedentary and migratory fish, reptiles, waterbirds and mammals. Primary productivity, dominated by cyanobacteria, algae and macrophytes, arises from allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources, which vary with lake and catchment characteristics, climate and hydrological connectivity. Productivity can be highly seasonal, depending on climate, light and nutrient availability. Permanent water and connectivity are critical to obligate freshwater biota, such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes. Trophic structure and complexity depend on lake size, depth, location and connectivity. Shallow lakes tend to be more productive (by volume and area) than deep lakes, with more complex trophic networks and stronger top-down regulation by predators. Deep lakes are more dependent on planktonic primary production, which is consumed by benthic microbial and invertebrate detritivores. Herbivorous fish and zooplankton regulate the main primary (biofilms and phytoplankton) and secondary producers (invertebrates). Detritivores, herbivores and carnivores vary with habitat structure, productivity and lake size. Small depth-stable lakes are prone to regime shifts between oligotrophic and eutrophic states. Terrestrial mammals use the lakes to drink and bathe, transferring of nutrients, organic matter and biota. Invertebrates, fish and waterbirds have specialised feeding traits tied to different habitat niches (e.g. benthic, pelagic) and presence or absence of high order predators, but there are few filter-feeders. In many regions, shallow lakes provide critical waterbird breeding habitat.

# Key-ecological-drivers

These lakes may be hydrologically isolated or connected to rivers, either terminally or as flow-through systems. Key ecological drivers include catchment rainfall amount and seasonality, size, depth (mixing regime and light penetration), pH, nutrients and catchment resources. Seasonal cycles of temperature, inflow and wind (which drives vertical mixing) may generate monomictic temperature stratification regimes in deeper lakes. Seasonal factors such as light, increases in temperature and flows into lakes can induce breeding and recruitment.

# Distribution

Mainly in humid temperate and tropical regions, but usually not semi-arid or arid regions.

**Map details**: Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of rivers and streams were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (http://www.feow.org/),  global and regional reviews , maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors.
