# Short description

These managed ecosystems are derived from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from biome T1 - biome T4, a few from biome T5) by the removal or modification of woody plant components. The remaining vegetation includes both local indigenous species and introduced species, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. They are used mainly for livestock grazing, which is essential to maintaining the structure of the system. Unlike sown pastures, inputs of water and nutrients are limited. Although structurally simpler than the systems from which they were derived, they often harbour an appreciable diversity of native organisms.

# Key Features

Extensively used, low-input grasslands (no or moderate fertilizer application, no sowing), rich in vascular plant species

# Distribution

In humid or sub-humid, boreal to tropical climates worldwide, mostly in regions with long agricultural tradition (e.g. Europe, western Asia)
