# Short description

Disused subterranean mines and other voids may fill with static or slowing moving water from seepage. The inhabitants of these ecosystems include biofilms comprising bacteria, aquatic fungi and protists that originated as colonists from surrounding groundwaters, or imported with people.  As well as the lack of light and low nutrient levels, productivity and diversity may be limited by heavy metals and toxins liberated during construction and mining of the voids.

# Key Features

Underground largely static low-productivity waterbodies often with large of warm groundwater or seepage, colonised by opportunistic microbes and invertebrates

# Distribution

Common in mineral rich regions of the world
