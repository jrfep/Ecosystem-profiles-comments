# Ecosystem properties

Abandoned and now flooded underground mines frequently contain extensive reservoirs of geothermally warmed groundwater, colonized by stygobitic invertebrates from nearby natural subterranean habitats. A fraction of the biota is likely to have been introduced by mining activities. A lack of light excludes photoautotrophs from these systems and low connectivity limits inputs from allochthonous energy sources. Consequently, overall productivity is low, and is likely to depend on chemoautrophic microbes (e.g. sulfate-reducing bacteria) as sources of energy. Few studies have investigated the ecology of the aquatic biota in quasi-stagnant water within mine workings, but trophic networks are truncated and likely to be simple, with low diversity and abundance at all trophic levels, and no endemism. Most of the resident heterotrophic biota are bacteria, aquatic fungi, and protists living in biofilms on artificial surfaces of abandoned infrastructure, equipment or cut rock faces. Extremophiles are likely to dominate in waters that are highly acidic or with high concentrations of heavy metals or other toxins. Micro-invertebrates are most likely to be the highest-level predators. Some voids may have simple assemblages of macroinverterbates, but few are likely to support vertebrates unless they are connected with surface waters that provide a means of colonization.

# Ecological Drivers

Like all subterranean ecosystems, light is absent or extremely dim in flooded mines. Unlike subterranean canals and pipes (SF2.1), mine waters are quasi-stagnant and not well connected to surface waters. During mine operation, water is pumped out of the mine forming a widespread cone of water table depression, with oxidation and hydrolysis of exposed minerals changing groundwater chemistry. When mines close and dewatering ceases, water table rebounds and the voids often flood. Some voids are completely inundated, while others retain a subterranean atmosphere, which may or may not be connected to the surface. Further changes in water chemistry occur after flooding due to dissolution and flushing of the oxidation products. Water is often warm due to geothermal heating. After inundation has stabilised, seepage and mixing may be slow, and stratification creates strong gradients in oxygen and solutes. Waters are acidic in most flooded mines. The ionic composition varies depending on mineralogy of the substrate, but ionic concentrations are typically high, and often contain heavy metals at levels toxic to some aquatic biota. Acid mine drainage is a common cause of pollution in surface rivers and streams, where it seeps to the surface.
