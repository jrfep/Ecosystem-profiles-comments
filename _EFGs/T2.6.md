# Ecological traits

Forests and woodlands, typically 10-30 m tall with an open evergreen sclerophyllous tree canopy and low-moderate LAI grow in fire-prone temperate landscapes. Productivity is lower than other temperate and tropical forest systems, limited by low nutrient availability and summer water deficits. Abundant light and water apart from peak summer enable development of substantial biomass with high C:N ratios. Trees have microphyll foliage with low to very low SLA. Sclerophyll or subsclerophyll shrubs with low-to-very low SLA foliage form a prominent layer between the trees. A sparse ground layer of C3 and C4 tussock grasses and forbs, becomes more prominent on soils of loamy texture. Diversity and local endemism may be high among some taxa including plants, birds and some invertebrates such as dipterans and hemipterans. Low nutrients and summer droughts limit diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels. Plant traits, such as sclerophylly, stomatal invagination, tubers and seedbanks, confer tolerance to pronounced but variable summer water deficits. Plants possess traits that promote efficient capture and retention of nutrients, including specialised root structures, N-fixing bacterial associations, slow leaf turnover, high allocation of photosynthates to structural tissues and exudates. Consumers have traits that enable consumption of high-fibre biomass. Mammalian herbivores (e.g. the folivorous koala) can exploit the high fibre content and phenolics. Plants and animals have morphological and behavioural traits that allow tolerance or avoidance of fire and the life-history processes of many taxa are cued to fire (especially plant recruitment). Key fire traits in plants include recovery organs protected by thick bark or burial, serotinous canopy seedbanks, physical and physiological seed dormancy and pyrogenic reproduction. Almost all plants are shade-intolerant and fire is a critical top-down regulator of diversity through storage effects and periodic disruption of plant competition. 

# Key-ecological-drivers

Hot summers generate a marked but variable summer water deficit, usually with a modest winter surplus, irrespective of whether rainfall is highly seasonal with winter maximum, aseasonal or weakly seasonal with interannually variable summer maxima. Soils are acidic, sandy or loamy in texture, and low to very impoverished in P and N. Hot summers define a marked season for canopy or surface fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Light frost occurs periodically in some areas but snow is rare.

# Distribution

Temperate regions of Australia, the Mediterranean and central California.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews (cited in respective reference sections of profiles), maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
