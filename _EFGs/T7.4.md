# Ecological traits

Dominated by high densities of humans, these systems are structurally complex and highly heterogeneous fine-scale spatial mosaics of multiple patch types including: buildings; paved surfaces; trees; grassed areas; gardens; bare ground; and refuse areas. These mosaics are dynamic over decadal time scales, driven by socio-ecological feedbacks and a human population that is highly stratified, functionally, socially and economically. Interactions among patch types and human social behaviours produce emergent properties and complex feedbacks among components within each system, and interactions with other ecosystem types. Unlike most other terrestrial ecosystems, the energy, water and nutrient sources of urban systems are highly allochthonous, and consequently processes within urban systems drive profound and extensive global changes in land use, land cover, biodiversity, hydrology and climate through both resource consumption and waste discharge on or in land, water and the atmosphere. Biotic community structure is characterised by low functional and taxonomic diversity, highly skewed rank-abundance relationships and relictual local endemism (among legacy biota). Trophic networks are therefore simplified and sparse, each node dominated by few taxa. Urban biota include humans, dependents (e.g.Â companion animals, cultivars), opportunists and vagrants, and legacy biota whose establishment pre-dates urbanisation. Many biota have highly plastic realised niches, traits enabling wide dispersal, high fecundity and short generation times. Persistence of dependent biota is maintained by anthropogenically assisted migration, managed reproduction, genetic manipulation, amelioration of temperatures and intensive supplementation of nutrients, food and water. Pest biota are controlled by application of herbicides, pesticides and/or culling with collateral impacts on non-target biota.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Humans influence availability of water, nutrients and energy deterministically through governance systems for resource importation and indirectly through interactions and feedbacks. Light is artificially enhanced at night. Urban temperature regimes are elevated by anthropogenic conversion of chemical energy to heat and absorption of solar energy by buildings and paved surfaces. However, temperatures may be locally ameliorated within buildings. Surface water runoff is enhanced and percolation is reduced by sealed surfaces. Recurring disturbances derive from socio-economic processes that drive infrastructure development and renewal, as well as natural disasters (storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunami). There is frequent movement of humans and associated biota and matter between cities.

# Distribution

Extensively scattered through equatorial to subpolar latitudes from sea-level to submontane altitudes, mostly in proximity to the coast, rivers or lakes, especially north America, western Europe and Japan, as well as India, China and Brazil.
