# Ecological traits

These low productivity autotrophic ecosystems are limited by winter dormancy during deep winter snow cover, extreme cold temperatures and frost during spring thaw, short growing seasons, desiccating winds, and seasonally low light intensity. Microbial decomposition rates are slow, promoting accumulation of peaty permafrost substrates in which only the surface horizon thaws seasonally. Vegetation is dominated by largely continuous cover of cold-tolerant bryophytes, lichens, C3 grasses, sedges, forbs and dwarf and prostrate shrubs. In the coldest and/or driest locations, vascular plants are entirely absent and productivity relies entirely on bryophytes, lichens, cyanobacteria and allochthonous energy sources such as guano. Aestivating insects dominate the invertebrate fauna. Vertebrate fauna is dominated by migratory birds, some of which travel seasonal routes exceeding several thousand kilometres. Many of these feed in distant wetlands or open oceans. These are critical mobile links that transfer nutrients and organic matter and disperse propagules other organisms, both externally on plumage or feet and endogenously. A few mammals in the northern hemisphere are hibernating residents or migratory herbivores. Pinipeds occur in near coast tundras and may be locally important in marine subsidies of nutrients and energy. Predatory canids and polar bears are nomadic or have large home ranges.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Winters are very cold and dark and summers define short, cool growing seasons with long hours of low daylight. Precipitation falls as snow which persists through winter months. In most areas, there is an overall water surplus, occasionally with small summer deficit, but some areas are ice-free polar deserts that are extremely dry (annual precipitation <150mm p.a.) with desiccating winds. Substrates are peaty or gravelly permafrost, which may partially thaw on the surface in summer, causing cryoturbation.

# Distribution

Primarily the within Arctic Circle and adjacent Subarctic regions, with smaller occurrences on Subantarctic islands and the Antarctic coast.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
