# Ecological traits

Submerged rocky reefs host trophically complex communities with sessile primary producers and sessile invertebrate filter feeders, respectively assimilating autothonous and allochthonous energy inputs. Although adult phases are sessile, larval stages and spores are dispersed widely by currents and during episodes of turbulence. Sessile plants include green, brown and red algae. These plants are low-growing ‘turf’ life forms with holdfasts, which protect them from being dislodged by storms. Many also possess traits such as air lacunae within tissues or bladders that promote buoyancy.Canopy algae (cf. M1.2) are sparse at the depths or exposure levels of this functional group. Algal productivity and abundance decline with depth due to diminution of light and are also kept in check by periodic storms and a diversity of herbivorous fish, molluscs and echinoderms. The latter two groups are benthic and consume algae primarily in turf form or at its juvenile stage before stipes develop. Sessile invertebrates occur throughout. Some (barnacles, anenomes) are high-turbulence specialists, while others (sponges, red algae) become dominant at greater depths as the abundance of faster-growing algae diminishes. Fish include both herbivores and predators. Some are specialist bottom-dwellers, while others are more generalist pelagic species. Herbivores promote diversity through top-down regulation, influencing patch dynamics, as mosaics of algal dominance, sessile invertebrate dominance and barrens may shift over time. Topographic variation in the rocky substrate promotes habitat diversity and spatial heterogeneity. This provides refuges from predators, but also hiding places for ambush predators including crustaceans and fish.
   

# Key-ecological-drivers

Minerogenic rocky substrates with variable topography and loose cobbles are foundational to the habitats of many plants and animals, and also influence how they capture resources and avoid predation. A strong depth gradient and substrate structures (e.g., overhangs and caves) limit light availability. Currents are crucial to delivery of resources, especially nutrients, and also play a key role in dispersal of biota. Salinity is relatively constant through time (3.5% on average). Turbulence from subsurface wave action promotes substrate instability and maintains high levels of dissolved oxygen. Episodic storms generating more extreme turbulence dislodge larger sessile organisms and create gaps that may be maintained by herbivores, or rapidly recolonized.

# Distribution

Widespread globally on rocky parts of continental and island shelves.

## Map details

These are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in yellow through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
