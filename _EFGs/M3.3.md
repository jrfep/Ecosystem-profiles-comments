# Ecological traits

This is the largest group of benthic marine ecosystems, extending between 3000 and 6000 m depth and covered by thick layers (up to thousands of meters) of fine sediment. Less than 1% of the seafloor has been investigated biologically. Tests of giant protozoans and the lebensspuren (tracks, borrows and mounds) made by megafauna structure the habitats of smaller organisms. Ecosystem engineering aside, other biotic interactions amongst large fauna are weak due to low densities of organisms. Abyssal communities are heterotrophic, with energy sources derived mostly from the fallout of organic matter particles (POC flux) through the water column. Seasonal variation in POC flux reflects temporal patterns in the productivity of the euphotic layers. Input of organic matter can also be through sporadic pulses of large falls (e.g. whale falls, wood falls). Most abyssal plains are food-limited and the quantity and quality of food input to the abyssal seafloor are strong drivers shaping the structure and function of abyssal communities. Abyssal biomass is very low, and dominated by meiofauna and microorganisms that play key roles in the functioning of the benthic communities below 3000 m depth. The abyssal biota, however, is highly diverse, mostly composed of macro- and meiofauna with large numbers of species new to science (up to 80% in some regions). Many species have so far been sampled only as singletons (only one specimen per species) or as a few specimens. The megafauna is often characterised by sparse populations of detritivores, notably echinoderms, crustaceans and demersal fish. Species distribution and major functions such as community respiration and bioturbation are linked to POC flux. These functions modulate important ecosystem services provided by abyssal plains, including nutrient regeneration and carbon sequestration.

# Key-ecological-drivers

No light penetrates to abyssal depths. Hydrostatic pressure is very high (300-600 atm). The water masses above abyssal plains are well oxygenated and characterised by low temperatures (-0.5 to 3°C), except in the Mediterranean (13°C) and the Red Sea (21°C). The main driver of most abyssal communities is food limitation, which mostly arrives to the seafloor as particulate organic carbon, or “marine snow”. Only 0.5 to 2% of the primary production in the euphotic zone reaches the abyssal seafloor, with the quantity decreasing with increasing depth.

# Distribution

Seafloor of all oceans between 3000 and 6000 m depth, accounting for 76% of the total seafloor area, segmented by mid-ocean ridges, island arcs and trenches.
