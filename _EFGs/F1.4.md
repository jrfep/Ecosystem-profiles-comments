# Ecological Traits
 
These seasonal riverine systems generally have low-moderate productivity and a relatively simple trophic structure. Aquatic algae are major contributors to in-stream food webs and productivity, but  riparian savannas and tropical dry forests both contribute significant quantities of allochthonous energy and organic carbon through leaf fall, which usually includes an annual deciduous component. Nonetheless, primary production is dependent on both light availability and flow. The biota is characterised by low taxonomic diversity but high levels of endemism. Traits that enable biota to persist in narrow and shallow channels with large seasonal variations in flow velocity, episodes of torrential flow and seasonal desiccation include small body sizes (especially in fish), dormant life phases, algal and invertebrate diets, visual feeding behaviour and sedentary (non-migratory) life cycles. The trophic structure is characterised by high representation of algal and invertebrate feeders and low numbers of carnivores, as well as birds with specialist feeding strategies (e.g. dippers). Diversity and abundances of invertebrates and their predators (e.g. birds) fluctuate during flooding regimes.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Flow and flood regimes in these rivers are highly variable between monsoon and dry seasons, with associated changes in water quality. They may be perennial or intermittent, with flows ceasing or much reduced in the dry season. Channels are narrow with steep to modearte gradients and seasonally high velocity and sometimes large volumes of water, producing overbank flows. This  results in considerable turbulence, turbidity and erosion during the wet season.

The distribution of Monsoonal upland stream was estimated using a global river environmental stratification database (Ouellet Dallaire et al. 2018). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>25%) and minor occurrences (< 25%) .
