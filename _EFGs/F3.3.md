# Ecological traits

Rice paddies are artificial wetlands with low horizontal and vertical heterogeneity, fed by rain or irrigation water diverted from rivers. They are predominantly temporary wetlands, regularly filled and dried, although some are permanently inundated, functioning as simplified marshes. Allochthonous inputs come from water inflow but also include introductions of rice and other production organisms (fish, crustaceans), and fertilisers that promote growth of rice. Simplified trophic networks are sustained by highly seasonal, deterministic flooding and drying regimes and agricultural management of harvest crops, weeds and pests. Cultivated macrophytes dominate primary production, but other autotrophs including archaea, cyanobacteria, phytoplankton and benthic or epiphytic algae also contribute. During flooded periods, microbial changes produce anoxic soil conditions and emissions by methanogenic archaea. Opportunistic colonists include consumers such as invertebrates, zooplankton, insects, fish, frogs and waterbirds, as well as other aquatic plants. Often they come from nearby natural wetlands or rivers with managed water and may breed within rice paddies. During dry phases, obligate aquatic organisms are confined to wet refugia, away from rice paddies, and possess traits that promote tolerance to low water quality and predator avoidance. Others organisms, including many invertebrates and plants, have rapid life cycles and dormancy traits allowing persistence as e.g. or seeds during dry phases.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Engineering of levees and channels enables water management to retain standing water a few centimetres above the soil surface and rapid drying at harvest time. This requires reliable water supply either through summer rains in the seasonal tropics or irrigation in warm temperate or semi-arid climates. The water has high oxygen content and usually warm temperatures. The deterministic water regimes and shallow depth limit niche diversity and have major influences on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils, which contain high nutrient levels. Rice paddies are often established on former floodplains, but may also be created on terraced hillsides. Other human interventions include cultivation and harvest, aquaculture and addition of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides.

More than a million square kilometres mostly in tropical and subtropical southeast Asia with small areas in Africa, Europe, South America, North America and Australia.
