# Ecological traits

Structurally simple tussock grasslands with interstitial forbs occur in subhumid temperate climates. Isolated trees or shrubs may be present in very low densities, but are generally excluded by heavy soil texture, summer drought, winter frost or recurring summer fires. Unlike tropical savannas (T4.1, T4.2 & T4.3), these systems are characterised by a mixture of both C3 and C4 grasses, with C4 grasses most abundant in summer or on dry sites, and C3 grasses predominating in winter or locally moist sites. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may be relatively high at small spatial scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is relatively high, as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich in nitrogen and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a relatively complex trophic network in which large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators and fossorial mammals are important in bioturbation and nutrient cycling. The mammals are less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most savannas. Taxonomic affinities vary between regions (e.g. ungulates, cervids, macropods, camelids), but their life history and dietary traits are convergent. Where grazing is not intense, leaf litter accumulates from the tussocks, creating a ‘thatch’, which is important habitat for ground-nesting birds, small mammals, reptiles and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of biomass. Plant competition plays a major role in structuring the ecosystem and its dynamics, with evidence that it is mediated by resource ratios and stress gradients, herbivory and fire regimes. The latter interrupt competition and promote coexistence of tussocks and interstitial forbs.

# Key-ecological-drivers

A strong seasonal water deficit in summer, driven by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures, despite an aseasonal or weakly seasonal rainfall pattern. Mean annual rainfall varies from 250mm to 750mm. Cold winter temperatures limit the growing season to 5-7 months, with frost and snow frequent in in continental locations, but summers are warm.  Soils are deep fertile organic, and usually fine-textured. Fires ignited by lightning occur in the drier summer months at subdecadal or decadal intervals.

# Distribution

Western Eurasia, northeast Asia, Midwest North America, Patagonia and Pampas regions of South America, southeast Africa, southeast Australia and southern New Zealand.

## Map details

Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
