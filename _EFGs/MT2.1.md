A low diversity of specialised plants and animals live in grasslands, shrublands, and low forests on coastlines above the high tide mark where they are exposed to harsh conditions of salt influx, desiccating winds and sunshine, and disturbances associated with storms or unstable substrates (e.g. cliffs and dunes). Plants, for example, exhibit traits such as succulence and rhizomes to promote persistence in these conditions, and many organisms are widely dispersed by winds or ocean currents. Consumers like seabirds or seals move between terrestrial and marine environments.

### Key Features

Coastal scrub limited by salinity, water deficit and disturbances (e.g. cliff collapse). Strong gradients from sea to land and highly mobile fauna..

### Overview of distribution

Coastal dunes and cliffs in tropical, temperate and boreal latitudes.
