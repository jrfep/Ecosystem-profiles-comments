# Ecological traits


Relatively low productivity grasslands, shrublands and low forests on exposed coastlines are limited by salt influx, water deficit and recurring disturbances. Diversity is low across taxa and trophic networks are simple, but virtually all elements (plants and animals) have strong dispersal traits and most consumers move between adjacent terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Vegetation and substrates are charcaterised by strong gradients from sea to land. Plant traits conferring salt tolerance, such as succulent and subsucculent leaves and salt excretion organs, are commonly represented. Woody plants with ramulose and/or decumbent growth forms and small (microphyll-nanophyll) leaves reflect mechanisms of persistence under exposure to strong salt-laden winds, while modular and rhizomatous growth forms promote persistence, regeneration and expansion under regimes of substrate instability and recurring disturbance. These strong environmental filters promote local adaptation, with specialised genotypes and phenotypes of more widespread taxa commonly represented on the strandline. Fauna are highly mobile, although some taxa, such as ground-nesting seabirds may be sedentary for some parts of their life cycles. Ecosystem dynamics is characterised by disturbance-driven cycles of disruption and renewal, with early phases dominated by colonists and in situ regenerators which often persist during the typically short intervals between successive disturbances.


# Key-ecological-drivers


Desiccating winds promote an overall water deficit, and appreciable exposure to salinity due to aerosol influx and salt spray. Warm-mild temperatures are moderated by direct maritime influence. Although above the regular intertidal zone, these systems are exposed to periodic disturbance from exceptional tides, coastal storm events, wind shear, bioturbation, and aeolian substrate mobility. Geomorphological depositional and erosional processes influence substrate stability and local vegetation succession.


# Distribution


Coastal dunes and cliffs throughout tropical, temperate and boreal latitudes.
