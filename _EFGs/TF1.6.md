Peat bogs in the boreal-subarctic and temperate areas of the world account for up to 40% of the worldâ€™s soil carbon. They are landscape sponges, with highly specialised plant life including shrubs, sedges and mosses equipped to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor, low-oxygen, waterlogged soils. Sphagnum moss and other peat-forming plants are foundational to these ecosystems. Insects are the dominant animal group, along with amphibians, reptiles, rodents and a few visiting birds.

### Key Features

Permanently ground water-logged (by rainwater-fed ground water,) nutrient poor, acidic sites on organic soils (peat); species poor, but high abundance of mosses, sedges and no to open woody species cover.

### Overview of distribution

Boreal and temperate humid zones of the northern hemisphere, limited occurrences in the southern hemisphere (southern South America, southern Australasia).
