# Ecological traits

Structurally simple, very low-diversity, high-productivity annual croplands are maintained by intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients, water and artificial disturbance regimes (annual cultivation), translocation (e.g. sowing) and harvesting of annual plants. These systems are dominated by one or few shallow-rooted annual plant species, such as grains (mostly C3 grasses), vegetables, ‘flowers’, legumes or fibre species harvested annually by humans for commercial or subsistence production of food, materials or ornamental display. Disequilibrium community structure and composition is maintained by translocations and/or managed reproduction of target species and periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores and/or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have very low functional, genetic and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism, and productivity is highly sensitive to variation in resource availability. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, insect predators and diseases. Croplands may be rotated interannually with livestock pastures or fallow fields (T7.2). Target biota coexists with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota (e.g. weedy plants, mice, starlings) that is able to exploit production landscapes opportunistically through efficient dispersal, itinerant foraging, rapid establishment, high fecundity and/or rapid population turnover. When actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively, this non-target biota becomes dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel systems.

# Key-ecological-drivers

High to moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is supplemented by human inputs via irrigation, landscape drainage modifications (surface earthworks) and/or fertiliser application by humans. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. These systems are typically associated with flat to moderate terrain, accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. annual ploughing) maintain soil turnover, aeration, nutrient release and relatively low soil organic carbon.

# Distribution

Tropical to temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and far north Africa, Europe, Asia, southern and southwestern Australasia, Oceania and the Americas.

{% capture map_det %} The indicative distribution of crop lands was estimated using the percentage cover of crop lands at 5' resolution from the Hyde 3.1 dataset (Klein Goldewijk & van Drecht 2006), with a threshold of 1% for minor occurrences and 10% for major occurrences. {% endcapture %}
