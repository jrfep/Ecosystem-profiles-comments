# Ecological traits

These structurally simple woodlands have space between open tree crowns and a ground layer characterised by tussock grasses with interstitial forbs and a variable shrub component. Grasses with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways are both common, but C4 grasses may be absent from the coldest and wettest sites or where rain rarely falls in summer. In any given area, C4 grasses are most abundant in summer or on dry sites or areas with summer-dominant rainfall, while C3 grasses predominate in winter, locally moist sites, cold sites or areas without summer rainfall. The ground flora also varies interannually depending on rainfall. Trees generate spatial heterogeneity in light, water and nutrients, which underpin a diversity of microhabitats and mediate competitive interactions among plants in the ground layer. Foliage is mostly microphyll and evergreen but transmitting abundant light or deciduous in colder climates. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may therefore be relatively high at local spatial scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is relatively high, as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich in nitrogen and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a relatively complex trophic network of invertebrate and vertebrate consumers. Large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators. Bioturbation by fossorial mammals influences soil structure, infiltration of water and nutrient cycling. The fauna is less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most tropical savannas (T4.1, T4.2), but includes large and small mammals, reptiles, a high diversity of birds and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of biomass. Plants and animals tolerate and persist through periodic ground fires that consume cured-grass fuels, but few have specialised traits cued to fire (cf. pyric ecosystems).

# Key-ecological-drivers

A water deficit occurs seasonally in summer, driven primarily by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures and, in some regions, seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall patterns. Mean annual rainfall is 350-1000mm. Low winter temperatures and occasional frost and snow may limit the growing season to 6-9 months.  Soils are usually fine-textured and relatively fertile, but nitrogen may be limiting in some areas. Fires burn mostly in the ground layers during the drier summer months at decadal intervals.

# Distribution

Temperate southeast and southwest Australia, Patagonia and Pampas of South America, western and eastern North America, the Mediterranean region and temperate Eurasia.

{% capture map_det %} Terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (https://www.worldwildlife.org/biome-categories/terrestrial-ecoregions), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts. {% endcapture %}
