Episodic arid floodplains rarely flood and are predominantly dry, sometimes for years.  They are supplied by temporary rivers in semi-arid and arid regions of all continents. When floods come, there is a spike in productivity as nutrients mobilise from leaf litter and organic matter. At such times, dormant plants and animals form complex food webs, capitalising on short periods of high productivity.

### Key Features

Highly productive floodplains when flooded, supporting highly diverse and complex trophic networks, followed by long periods of low productivity when dry.

### Overview of distribution

Semi-ard and arid regions.
