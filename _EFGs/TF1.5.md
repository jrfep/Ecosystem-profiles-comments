# Ecological Traits
 

Highly episodic freshwater floodplains are distinct from, but associated with, adjacent river channels, which provide water and sediment during flooding. These are low-productivity systems during long dry periods (may be years), with periodic spikes of very high productivity when first inundated. These floodplains have a high diversity of aquatic and terrestrial biota in complex trophic networks, with ruderal life-history traits enabling exploitation of transient water and nutrients availability. Primary producers include flood-dependent macrophytes and algae with physiological traits for water conservation or drought avoidance. Lower trophic levels (algae, zooplankton, crustacea) avoid desiccation with traits such as dormant life cycle phases, deposition of resting eggs (e.g. anostracans, notostracans, cladocerans, rotifers), and burial in sediments ‘banks’ (e.g. larvae of cyclopoid copepods). Higher trophic levels (fish, amphibians and waterbirds) are highly mobile or with resting strategies (e.g. burrowing frogs). These taxa can be important mobile links for the movement of biota and resources, but floods are the primary allochthonous sources of energy and nutrients. Floods are important triggers for life-history processes, such as seed germination, emergence from larval stages and reproduction. Common life forms include detritus-feeding invertebrate collector-gatherers, indicating a reliance on heterotrophic energy pathways.

 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 

Multi-year dry periods are punctuated by brief intervals of shallow inundation caused by overspill from flooding river channels. These boom-bust systems have temporarily high productivity driven by water and partly by elevated levels of dissolved carbon and nutrients (notably N and P) released from leaf litter, oxygen and organic matter in newly inundated, shallow areas. Typically, high temperatures promote productivity and rapid drying in the arid environment. Water may be turbid or clear, which affects the light environment, and may limit benthic algal production to the shallow littoral margins of small channels. This in turn affects aquatic foodwebs and carbon dynamics. Drainage is predominantly horizontal and bidirectional (i.e. in and out of the river), but infiltration and evapotranspiration can be significant in the flat terrain and may influence salinity if there are sources of salt in the catchment or ground water.

Connected to ephemeral rivers in semi-arid regions of all continents, less common in arid regions.

Location of pan, brackish and saline wetlands was taken from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (Lehner and Döll 2004). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>30%) and minor occurrences (< 30%).
