# Ecosystem properties

These grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 grasses with stoloniferous, rhizomatous and tussock growth forms that are kept short by vertebrate grazers. Trophic savannas (relative to pyric savannas, T4.2) have unique plant and animal diversity within a complex trophic structure dominated by abundant mammalian herbivores and predators. These animals are functionally differentiated in body size, mouth morphology, diet, and behaviour. They promote fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity and dominance of short grass species, sustaining the system through positive feedbacks and limiting fire fuels. Trees and grasses possess functional traits that promote tolerance to chronic herbivory as well as seasonal drought. Seasonal high productivity coincides with summer rains. The dry season induces grass drying and leaf fall in deciduous and semi-deciduous woody plants. Trees are shade-intolerant during their establishment and most develop chemical (e.g. phenolics) or physical (e.g. spinescence) herbivory defence traits and an ability to re-sprout as they enter the juvenile phase. Their soft microphyll-notophyll foliage has relatively high SLA and low C:N ratios, as do grasses. Robust root systems and stolons/rhizomes enable characteristic grasses to survive and spread under heavy grazing. As well as vertebrate herbivores and predators, vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Nitrogen fixation, recycling, and deposition by animals exceeds volatilisation.

# Ecological Drivers

Trophic savannas like pyric savannas are driven by seasonal climates but generally occupy environmental niches with lower rainfall and higher soil fertility. High annual rainfall deficit of 400 mm to >1,800 mm. Annual rainfall generally varies from 300 mm to 700 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought, but these savanna types are restricted to landscapes with sufficient water bodies (rivers and lakes) to sustain high densities of large mammals. Temperatures are warm-hot with low-moderate variability through the year. Low intensity fires have return intervals of 5â€“50 years, depending on animal densities and inter-annual rainfall variation, usually after the growing season, removing much of the remaining biomass not consumed by herbivores. Soils are moderately fertile and often have a significant clay component.
