# Ecosystem properties

These closed-canopy forests and thickets have drought-deciduous or semi-deciduous phenology in at least some woody plants (rarely fully evergreen), and thus seasonally high LAI. Strongly seasonal photoautotrophic productivity is limited by a regular annual water deficit/surplus cycle. Diversity is lower across most taxa than T1.1, but tree and vertebrate diversity is high relative to most other forest systems. Plant growth forms and leaf sizes are less diverse than in T1.1. Grasses are rare or absent, except on savanna ecotones, due to canopy shading and/or water competition, while epiphytes, ferns, bryophytes, and forbs are present but limited by seasonal drought. Trophic networks are complex with low exclusivity and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous, and carnivorous vertebrates. Fungi and other microbes are important decomposers of abundant leaf litter and N-fixing plants can be abundant. Many woody plants are dispersed by wind and some by vertebrates. Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the litter layer. Trees typically have thin bark and low fire tolerance and can recruit in shaded microsites, unlike many in savannas. Plants are tolerant of seasonal drought but can exploit moisture when it is seasonally available through high SLA and plastic productivity. Gap-phase dynamics are driven primarily by individual tree-fall and exploited by seedling banks and vines (seedbanks are uncommon). These forests may be involved in fire-regulated stable-state dynamics with savannas.

# Ecological Drivers

Overall water surplus (or small deficit <100 mm), but a substantial seasonal deficit in winter in which little or no rain falls within a 4–7-month period. Warm temperatures (minima rarely <10°C) with low-moderate diurnal and seasonal variability in the tropics, but greater seasonal variability in subtropical continental areas. Diverse substrates generally produce high levels of nutrients. Tropical storms may be important disturbances in some areas but flammability is low due to limited ground fuels except on savanna ecotones.
