# Ecological Traits
 
These closed-canopy forests and scrubs have drought-deciduous or semi-deciduous phenology in at least some woody plants (rarely fully evergreen), and thus seasonally high LAI. Strongly seasonal photoautotrophic productivity is limited by a regular annual water deficit/surplus cycle. Diversity is lower across most taxa than T1.1, but tree and vertebrate diversity is high relative to most other forest systems. Plant growth forms and leaf sizes are less diverse than in T1.1. Grasses are rare or absent due to canopy shading and/or water competition, while epiphytes, ferns, bryophytes and forbs are present but limited by seasonal drought. Trophic networks are complex with low exclusivity and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous and carnivorous vertebrates. Fungi and other microbes are important decomposers of abundant leaf litter. Many woody plants are dispersed by wind and some by vertebrates. Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the litter layer. Trees typically have thin bark, low fire tolerance and are able to recruit in shaded microsites. Plants are tolerant of seasonal drought but able to exploit moisture when it is seasonally available through high SLA and strongly plastic productivity. Gap-phase dynamics is driven primarily by individual tree-fall, exploited by seedling banks and vines (seedbanks are uncommon). These forests may be involved in fire-regulated stable state dynamics with savannas.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Overall water surplus (or small deficit<100 mm), but a substantial seasonal deficit in 'winter' in which little or no rain falls within a 4-7 month period. Warm temperatures (minima rarely below 10°C) with low-moderate diurnal and seasonal variability in the tropics, but greater seasonal variability in subtropical continental areas. Substrates are diverse and generally produce high levels of nutrients. Tropical storms may be important disturbances in some areas but flammability is low due to limited ground fuels.

# Distribution
 
Seasonally dry tropical and subtropical regions in central and west Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, north and northern and eastern Australia, the Pacific, central and south America and the Caribbean.

{% capture map_det %}
Areas of deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest cover were identified from consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014), and cropped to areas of tropical climates (Beck et al. 2018), occurrences were then aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and reclassified as major occurrences (>80% occurrence) and minor occurrences (< 80% occurrence).
