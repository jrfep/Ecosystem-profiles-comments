These lakes are usually large and shallow in semi-arid regions, with high concentrations of salts, mediated by inflows of water.  Their productivity from growth of algae and plants can support large numbers, but low diversity of organisms equipped with tolerance to high salinity and other solutes. They have relatively simple foodwebs, with high numbers of microbes and plankton, crustaceans, insect larvae, fish and specialised waterbirds such as flamingos.

### Key Features

Permanent waterbodies with high inorganic solute concentrations (particularly sodium), supporting simple trophic networks, including cyanobacteria and algae, invertebrates and specialist birds.

### Overview of distribution

Mostly in semi-arid regions of Africa, southern Australia, Eurasia, Europe and western North and South America.
