# Ecosystem properties

Closed-canopy evergreen forests on tropical mountains usually have a single-layer low tree canopy (~5–20m tall) with small leaf sizes (microphyll-notophyll) and moderate-high SLA. They transition to lowland rainforests (T1.1) with decreasing altitude and to warm temperate forests (T2.4) at higher latitudes. Structure and taxonomic diversity become more diminutive and simpler with altitude, culminating in elfinwood forms. Conspicuous epiphytic ferns, bryophytes, lichens, orchids, and bromeliads drape tree branches and exploit atmospheric moisture (cloud stripping), but grasses are rare or absent, except for bamboos in some areas. Moderate productivity fuelled by autochthonous energy is limited by high exposure to UV-B radiation, cool temperatures, and sometimes by shallow soil or wind exposure. Limited energy and sequestration in humic soils may limit N and P uptake. Growth and reproductive phenology is usually seasonal. Plant propagules are dispersed mostly by wind and territorial birds and mammals. Tree diversity is moderate to low, while epiphytes are diverse, but there is often high local endemism at higher altitudes in most groups, especially amphibians, birds, plants, and invertebrates. Gap-phase dynamics are driven by tree-fall, landslides, lightning strikes, or in some areas more rarely by extreme wind storms. Seedling banks are common (seedbanks are uncommon) and most plants are shade tolerant and can recruit in the shade.

# Ecological Drivers

Substantial cloud moisture and high humidity underpin a reliable year-round rainfall surplus over evapotranspiration. Altitudinal gradients in temperature, precipitation, and exposure are pivotal in ecosystem structure and function. Frequent cloud cover from orographic uplift and closed tree canopies maintain a moist microclimate and shady conditions. Temperatures are mild-cool with occasional frost. Seasonal variability is low-moderate but diurnal variability is moderate-high. Winter monthly mean minima may be around 0°C in some areas. Landslides are a significant form of disturbance that drives successional dynamics on steep slopes and is exacerbated by extreme rainfall events. Mountains experience elevated UV-B radiation with altitude and, in some regions, are exposed to local or regional storms.
