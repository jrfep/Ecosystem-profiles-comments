# Ecological traits


These ecosystems are founded on intertidal or subtidal three-dimensional biogenic structures, formed primarily by high densities of oysters and/or mussels, which provide habitat for a moderate diversity of algae, invertebrates and fishes, though endemism is relatively low. They may have high (reefs) or low (beds) structural profiles and are usually situated on otherwise sedimentary or rocky substrate. Pen shells are an exception, however, as they form high density beds of vertically orientated non-gregarious animals in soft sediments. Sessile filter-feeders dominate these strongly heterotrophic, but relatively high-productivity systems, utilising tidal energy to bring in food and carry away waste. Ene.g. and matter in waste is processed by a subsystem of deposit-feeding invertebrates. Predators are only a small component of the ecosystem, but are nevertheless important in influencing the recruitment, biomass and diversity of prey organisms. Shellfish beds and reefs may influence adjoining estuaries and coastal waters physically and biologically. Physically, they remove suspended particulate matter through filter-feeding, modify patterns of currents, and dampen wave energy. Biologically, they remove phytoplankton and produce large quantities of oyster biomass.


# Key-ecological-drivers


 The availability of hard-substrate (including shell of live and dead conspecifics) can limit establishment of reef-forming shellfish, though a few occur on soft substrates. Many shellfish are robust to changes in salinity, closing their valves for days to weeks to avoid unfavourable conditions, but salinity may indirectly influence survival by determining susceptibility to parasites. High suspended sediment loads caused by high energy tides, rainfall and runoff events or erosion of coastal catchments can smother larvae, and impede filter feeding. Shellfish cannot survive prolonged periods of low dissolved oxygen; in subtidal environments formation of reefs can help to elevate animals above anoxic bottom waters. Relatively (or entirely) immobile and thin-shelled juveniles are highly susceptible to benthic predators such as crabs, fishes and birds, and recruitment to adult populations can be contingent on protective microhabitats provided either by abiogenic or biogenic structures. In intertidal environments, survival of shellfish can increase with density due to self-shading and moisture retention.

# Distribution


Estuarine and coastal waters of temperate and tropical regions, extending from subtidal to intertidal zones. Present-day distributions are shaped by historic overharvest, which has removed 85% of reefs, globally.


## Map details

Ecoregions with major and minor occurrences of Shellfish beds and reefs were identified by overlaying a global map of oyster reefs (Beck et al. 2011) on marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008), and then clipping to the extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
