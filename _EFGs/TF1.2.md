# Ecological Traits
 
These hydrophilic forests and scrubs have an open to closed tree or shrub canopy, 2-40m  tall, dependent on flood regimes or groundwater lenses. Unlike tropical forests (TF1.1), they typically are dominated by one or very few woody species. Trees engineer fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in resource availability (water, nutrients and light) and ecosystem structure, which much affects the composition, form and functional traits of understorey plants and fauna. Engineering processes include alteration of surface microtopography by growth of large roots, deposition of leaf litter and woody debris, canopy shading and development of foraging or nesting substrates (e.g. tree hollows). Forest understories vary in response to spatial and temporal hydrological gradients, which influence density, the abundance of algae and relative composition of hydrophytes and ‘terrestrial’ plants.  Primary production varies seasonally and interannually, and can be periodically high due to mobilization of nutrients on floodplains during inundation. If nutrients accumulate on floodplains during dry phases, this flushing sometimes may lead to microbial blooms, aquatic anoxia and fish kills. Plant and animal life-histories are closely connected to inundation (e.g. seedfall and germination stimulated by flooding). Inundation-phase aquatic foodwebs are moderately complex. Fish, frogs and birds exploit the alternation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. Waterbirds forage extensively on the secondary production, stranded as floodplains recede, and breed in the canopies of trees or mid-storey. Riparian forests are refuges for many vertebrates during droughts. Itinerant mammalian herbivores (e.g. deer, kangaroos) may have locally important impacts on vegetation structure and recruitment.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These forests occur on lowland flats, floodplains and riparian corridors. Seasonally and interannually variable water supply influences ecosystem dynamics. Allochthonous water and nutrient subsidies from upstream catchments supplement local resources and promote extension of floodplain forests and their biota into arid regions (‘green tongues’). Water movement is critical for connectivity and movement of biota. High energy floods in riparian corridors displace standing vegetation and woody debris, redistribute nutrients and create opportunities for recruitment. Low energy environments with slow drainage promote peat accumulation. Extreme drying and heat events may generate episodes of tree dieback and mortality. Fires may occur in depending on frequency of fire weather, ignition sources and landscape context.

Location of wetlands from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (Lehner and Döll 2004) were overlapped with mixed forest cover from consensus land cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) and temperate climate zones (Beck et al. 2018). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>30%) and minor occurrences (< 30%).
