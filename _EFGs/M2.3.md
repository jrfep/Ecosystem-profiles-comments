# Ecological traits


These are deep, open-ocean ecosystems in the water column generally between 1000-3000 metres depth. Energy sources are allochthonous, derived mainly from fallout of particulate organic matter from the epipelagic horizon (M2.1). Total biomass declines exponentially from an average of 1.45 mg C m-3 at 1000 m depth to 0.16 mg C m-3 at 3000 m. Trophic structure is truncated, with no primary producers. Instead, the major components are zooplankton, micro-crustaceans (shrimps), medusazoans (jellyfish), cephalopods and four main guilds of fish: gelativores; zooplanktonivores, micronecktonivores and generalists. Many species (especially zooplanktivores, but also some other fish) migrate vertically to the mesopelagic zone (M2.2) or near the surface at night to feed. Larvae often hatch from buoyant egg masses at the surface to take advantage of food sources. Long generation lengths (>20 years in most fish) and low fecundity, reflect low energy availability. Fauna typically have low metabolic rates, with bathypelagic fish having rates of oxygen consumption c. 10% of that in epipelagic fish. Fish are consequently slow swimmers with high water content in muscles and relatively low red:white muscle tissue ratios. They also have low-density bodies, reduced skeletons, and/or specialised buoyancy organs to achieve neutral buoyancy for specific depth ranges. Traits related to lack of light include reduced eyes, lack of pigmentation and enhanced vibratory and chemosensory organs. Some planktonic forms, medusas and fish have internal light organs that produce intrinsic or bacterial bioluminescence to attract prey items, mates or defend themselves. Most of the biota possesses cell membranes with specialised phospholipid composition, intrinsic modifications of proteins and protective osmolytes to optimise protein function at high pressure.


# Key-ecological-drivers


No light penetrates from the ocean surface to bathypelagic waters. Oxygen concentrations are not limiting to aerobic respiration (mostly 3-7ml.l-1) and are recharged through thermohaline circulation by cooling. Oxygenated water is circulated globally from two zones (Weddel Sea and far North Atlantic Ocean) where ice formation and surface cooling create high salinity oxygenated water that sinks, and is subsequently circulated globally via the ‘great ocean conveyor’. Re-oxygenation frequency varies from 300-1000 years, depending on the circulation route. More local thermohaline circulation occurs by evaporation in the Mediterranean and Red seas, resulting in warm temperatures (13-15°C) at bathyl depths. Otherwise, bathypelagic temperatures vary from -1°C in polar waters to 2-4°C in tropical and temperate waters. Nutrient levels are low and derive from the fall of organic remains from surface horizons. Pressure varies with depth from 100-300 atmospheres.


# Distribution


All oceans or deep seas beyond the continental slope and deeper than 1000m.


## Map details

Indicative distributions of these marine pelagic ecosystem functional groups were derived from bathymetric spatial data obtained from Becker et al. (2009) using depth range thresholds cited in respective descriptive profiles for each functional group.
