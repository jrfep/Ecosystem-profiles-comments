# Ecological traits

The seasonally frozen surface of polar oceans, ~ 1 - 2m (Antarctic) or 2 – 3 m (Arctic) thick, may be connected to land or permanent ice shelves and is one of the most dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Sympagic (ice associated) organisms occur in all physical components of the sea-ice system including the surface; the internal matrix and brine channel system; the underside; and nearby waters modified by sea ice presence. Primary production by microalgal and microbial communities beneath and within sea ice form the base of the food web and waters beneath sea ice develop standing stocks significantly higher than in ice free areas, despite shading by the ice. These are grazed by diverse zooplankton including krill. The sea ice underside provides refuge from surface predators and is an important nursery for juvenile krill and fish. Deep water fish migrate vertically to feed on zooplankton beneath sea ice. High secondary production in sea ice and around its edges, particularly of krill, supports seals, seabirds, penguins (Antarctic) and baleen whales. The highest trophic levels include vertebrate predators such as polar bears (Arctic), leopard seals and toothed whales. Sea ice also provides resting and/or breeding habitats for seals, polar bears and penguins. As the sea ice decays annually it releases biogenic material consumed by grazers, and particulate and dissolved organic matter, nutrients, fresh water and iron, which stimulate phytoplankton growth and has an important role in biogeochemical cycling.

# Key-ecological-drivers

Sea ice is integral to the global climate system and has a crucial influence on pelagic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical processes. It limits atmosphere/ocean gas and momentum exchanges; regulates sea temperature; reflects solar radiation; acquires snow cover; and redistributes freshwater to lower latitudes. The annual retreat of sea ice during spring and summer initiates high phytoplankton productivity at the marginal ice zone, and provides a major resource for grazing zooplankton including krill. Polynyas, where areas of low ice concentration are bounded by high ice concentrations, have very high productivity levels. Most sea ice is pack ice transported by wind and currents. Fast ice forms a stationary substrate anchored to the coast, icebergs, glaciers and ice shelves, and can persist for decades.

# Distribution

Arctic Ocean 0 to 45°N (Japan) or only to 80°N (Spitsbergen). Southern Ocean from ~ 55 to 70°S. At maximum extent sea ice covers ~5% of the Northern Hemisphere and 8% of the Southern Hemisphere.

## Map details

Indicative distributions of Sea ice were obtained from Fetterer et al. (2017). To approximate the maximum annual global extent, we used the monthly extent for March 2019 for the northern hemisphere, and the monthly extent for September 2018 for the southern hemisphere.
