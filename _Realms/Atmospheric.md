The **Atmospheric realm** includes the gaseous medium and its suspended particulate liquids and solids above the terrestrial realm, extending to the altitudinal limits of life.

Altitudinal gradients strongly structure the diminishing availability of water and nutrients, coincident with declines in ambient temperatures and barometric pressure, and increasing UV-B radiation (Table 3). Nonetheless, atmospheric ecosystems are among the most dynamic over time scales of days to decades driven by planetary oscillations. ***We deferred resolution of lower levels within the atmospheric realm, due to the currently poor knowledge base on biotic components of these ecosystems***. Additional challenges to classifying atmospheric ecosystems are posed by their sparse and itinerant biota, represented mainly by dispersive life stages. Meteorological classifications based on patterns of weather and air masses suggest a way forward to identify distinguishing drivers and traits of atmospheric ecosystems.
