  description: "Mapping of intensive livestock pastures was based on fractional land\
    \ use mapping (Ramankutty et al. 2008), dasymetric estimates of ruminant livestock\
    \ density for cattle and sheep (Gilbert et al. 2010), and Human Appropriation\
    \ of Net Primary Production (HANPP, Haberl et al. 2007). Fractional land use cover\
    \ indicated firstly where pastures occur and secondly where they occupy a large\
    \ portion of area relative to croplands. This helped to exclude intensive croplands\
    \ that are also used to graze livestock, either through temporal rotation or on\
    \ the margins of cropped paddocks (e.g. in south Asia). Livestock densities indicated\
    \ where ruminants were important components of pasture systems, and helped exclude\
    \ some rangelands with low livestock densities. Finally, HANPP helped exclude\
    \ low productivity rangelands with high stocking rates and additional areas of\
    \ cropland. We explored different combinations and thresholds for the input data\
    \ layers, visually inspecting the output in South Asia, Australia, West Africa,\
    \ and North and South America. We then mapped major occurrences where pasture\
    \ area fraction greater than zero (PAF>0) and greater than cropland area fraction\
    \ (PAF-CAF>0), densities of cattle or sheep were greater than 500 per cell, and\
    \ 100 < HANPP < 700 gC/m\xB2/yr. We examined the sensitivity of mapped area to\
    \ variation in these thresholds and found no appreciatble change in the global\
    \ mapped area when livestock density was varied by \xB120% and marginal change\
    \ in mapped area with variation in the other thresholds by the same amount. To\
    \ represent this uncertainty, we mapped minor occurrences as the additional area\
    \ where PAF>0, PAF-CAP>-0.2 and 80 < HANPP < 840 gC/m\xB2/yr. We acknowledge significant\
    \ untested assumptions and limitations on spatial predictors that challenge the\
