<td> Freshwater ecoregions  (Abell et al. 2008) were initially identified as containing permanent upland streams if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identifed in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. The selected ecoregions were then clipped to exlude cold or dry climates (mean temperature of coldest quarter >0°C, mean annual preipitation >300mm) based on data from Karger et al. (2017). Major occurrences were mapped by intersecting the selected ecoregions with the distribution of 1st-3rd order streams taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution (Linke et al. 2019). The remaining areas within selected ecoregions (excluding freeze/thaw areas) were designated as minor occurrences.</td>

We compared this to areas of tropical swamp forest and flooded forest mapped Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (Lehner and Döll, 2004) as well as ecoregions with such forests mentioned in their description (Dinerstein et al., 2017), and found that maps of Jung et al. (2020) more closely matched the concept of TF1.1.</td>
