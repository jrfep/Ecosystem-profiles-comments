# Global ecosystem typology

This site is dedicated to open consultation and review of profiles for Ecosystem Functional Groups (level 3) of the Global Ecosystem Typology.
## Introduction

A global ecosystem typology shaped around robust design principles is essential information infrastructure for well-informed decisions to achieve dual, internationally mandated goals of conserving biodiversity and sustaining ecosystem services. These overarching goals require parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity to report on progress towards the [Aichi Targets at the Conference of Parties in 2020](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/).

We undertook a global-scale assessment of ecosystem degradation ([Target 5](https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/targets/T5-quick-guide-en.pdf)), some of its causes and protective action ([Target 11](https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/targets/T5-quick-guide-en.pdf)) using available data on the distribution of ecosystem functional groups, spatial patterns in ecosystem stressors and the distribution of protected areas.
