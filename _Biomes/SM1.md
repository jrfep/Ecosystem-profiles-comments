# Description
 The subterranean tidal biome includes coastal subterranean voids with a partially or completed submerged connection to marine waters. Like all other subterranean ecosystems, sunlight is absent or too dim to sustain photosynthesis. Marine shelf ecosystems (M1) connected to these subterranean systems are their primary source of allochthonous energy, as well as nutrients and oxygenation. The marine interface also generates a marked salinity gradient, which is not present in other subterranean ecosystems. Physiological traits enabling osmotic regulation equip the biota for life in saline waters. The truncated trophic webs of subterranean marine systems lacks photoautotrophs but, compared to other subterranean ecosystems, there may be relatively diverse assemblages of heterotrophic microbes, scavengers, suspension-feeders and predators. Some of these organisms have close relatives on the deep sea floor (M3) and share traits with those in other low-productivity, dark biomes including depigmentation, reduced visual organs, increased tactile and chemical sensitivity, low fecundity, long life spans, slow metabolism and growth rates. Tides are an important means of hydrological mixing, resource flux, biotic dispersal and perturbation in some systems. They also influence the relative abundance of marine suspension feeders, particularly sponges and other sessile invertebrates.
