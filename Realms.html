<h1>Realms</h1>

<p>The five realms represent all parts of the biosphere. A conceptual model of ecosystem assembly was used to describe and compare the ecological drivers and traits that characterise the five realms. This comparative analysis helped to identify major gradients of variation and informed the definition of <a href="Biomes.html">functional biomes (level 2)</a> and <a href="EFGs.html">ecosystem functional groups (level 3)</a> within each realm.</p>

<h3>A note on transitional realms</h3>
<p>Transitional realms accommodate continuous variation among the core units. The interface between terrestrial and freshwater realms is occupied by palustrine wetlands, some of which accumulate peat under impeded substrate drainage. The freshwater-marine transitional realm is occupied by brackish aquatic ecosystems on marine coasts. The marine-terrestrial transitional realm is characterised by steep environmental gradients in desiccation, salinity and wave and tide disturbance, occupied by contrasting shoreline ecosystems. The interface of marine and terrestrial seepage is sometimes influenced by seepage or outflow of freshwater, supporting intertidal wetlands and deltaic systems. Unique ecosystems also occur where the subterranean realm meets the interface of freshwater and marine realms, respectively.</p>
<p>The functional biomes belonging to these transitional realms are linked to all their parent realms.</p>
